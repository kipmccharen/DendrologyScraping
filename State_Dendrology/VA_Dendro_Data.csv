Another report says that it is a turpentine[171]. The term Canada Balsam is a misnomer because balsams are supposed to contain benzoic and cinnamic acids, both absent from the Canada oleoresin[269]. Turpentine is also a misnomer, implying that the oleoresin is entirely steam volatile. Actually it contains 70 - 80% resin, only 16 - 20% volatile oil[269]. Canada Balsam yields 15 - 25% volatile oil, the resin being used for caulking and incense[269]. It is used medicinally and in dentistry, also in the manufacture of glues, candles and as a cement for microscopes and slides - it has a high refractive index resembling that of glass[11, 46, 64, 82, 222, 226, 238]. The pitch has also been used as a waterproofing material for the seams of canoes[257]. The average yield is about 8 - 10 oz per tree[171]. The resin is also a fixative in soaps and perfumery[171, 238]. ""Turpentine"" is usually collected during July-August by breaking the turpentine blisters into small metal cans with sharp-pointed lids. Trees are then allowed to recuperate for 1 - 2 years before being harvested again[269]. The leaves and young branches are used as a stuffing material for pillows etc - they impart a pleasant scent[46, 61, 257] and also repel moths[169]. The leaves contain an average of 0.65% essential oil, though it can go up to 1.4% or even higher[269]. One analysis of the essential oils reports 14.6% bornyl acetate, 36.1% b-pinene, 11.1% 3-carene, 11.1% limonene, 6.8% camphene, and 8.4% a-pinene[269]. To harvest the oil, it would appear that the branches should be snipped off younger trees in early spring[269]. Fifteen year old trees yield 70% more leaf oil than 110-year-old trees; oil yields are highest in January - March and September, they are lowest from April to August[269]. A thread can be made from the roots[257]. Wood - light, soft, coarse grained, not strong, not very durable. Weighs 24lb per cubic foot[235]. Used mainly for pulp, it is not used much for lumber except in the manufacture of crates etc[46, 82, 226, 229]. The wood is commercially valuable for timber even though it is relatively soft, weak, and perishable[269]. Balsam fir is used in the US for timber and plywood, and is the mainstay of the pulp wood industry in the Northeast.

Very shade tolerant, especially when young[81, 126], but growth is slower in dense shade[81]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[1]. Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about5[200], though the cultivar 'Hudsonia' is more tolerant of alkaline conditions[238]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[200]. A shallow-rooted plant, making it vulnerable to high winds[229]. Balsam fir is estimated to tolerate an annual precipitation of 60 to 150cm, an annual temperature range of 5 to 12Â°C, and a pH of 4.5 to 7.5[269]. The balsam fir is a fast-growing tree in its native environment[229], but it is fairly short-lived and slow growing in Britain, becoming ungainly after about 20 years[11, 64, 81]. It grows best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland[11, 185]. New growth takes place from late May to the end of July[185]. Trees are very cold hardy but are often excited into premature growth in mild winters and this new growth is susceptible to damage by late frosts[11]. Female strobili may be wholly or partially aborted up to 6 to 8 weeks after bud burst by late spring frosts[269]. Pollen dispersal can be reduced by adverse weather[269]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Trees have a thin bark and are therefore susceptible to forest fires[229]. This species is closely related to A. fraseri[11]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. The cones break up on the tree and if seed is required it should be harvested before the cones break up in early autumn[80]. Whilst the typical species is too large for most gardens, there are some named slow-growing dwarf forms that can be grown[238]. Whilst these will not provide the resin, their leaves can be used medicinally[K]. The leaves are strongly aromatic of balsam when crushed[185]. The tree is sometimes grown and used as a 'Christmas tree'[226]. Special Features:\r\nNorth American native, There are no flowers or blooms.""]","['Seed - sow early February in a greenhouse or outdoors in March[78]. Germination is often poor, usually taking about 6 - 8 weeks[78]. Stratification is said to produce a more even germination so it is probably best to sow the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[80, 113]. Stored seeds should be moist stratified 14 - 28 days at 1 - 5Â°C, though fresh seed may be sown in autumn without stratification, with target seedling densities in the nursery ca 450 - 500/m2, often mulched with sawdust. The seed remains viable for up to 5 years if it is well stored[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for at least their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Of slow initial growth, the stock is usually outplanted as 2- to 3-year-old seedlings or 3- to 4-year-old transplants Alternatively, if you have sufficient seed, it is possible to sow in an outdoor seedbed. One report says that it is best to grow the seedlings on in the shade at a density of about 550 plants per square metre[78] whilst another report says that they are best grown on in a sunny position[80].

Another report says that it is an emergency food and is only used when all else fails[183]. An aromatic resinous pitch is found in blisters in the bark[64]. When eaten raw it is delicious and chewy[101, 183]. Another report says that the balsam or pitch, in extreme emergency, forms a highly concentrated, though disagreeable, food[269].

The plant prefers a light moist soil and a sheltered position[1, 133]. Prefers a position in full sun or partial shade[238]. The tree is estimated to tolerate an annual precipitation of 30 to 250cm (tolerating a dry season up to 8 months), an annual average temperature of 10Â° to 20Â°C, and a pH of 5.5 to 8.0. Growing on the smallest of city plots and rubbish heaps, this species obviously can tolerate a wide array of soils, from acid to alkaline, sand to light clay, well-drained to swampy, poor to rich. It is said to do poorly on chalky soils or compact clay[269]. Plants are hardy to at least -15Â°c[200].

The trees send up suckers freely and soon form dense thickets[7, 200, 229]. The plant has become a noxious weed in parts of Australia and is rather weed-like in many other countries[238, 269]. The roots are rather aggressive and can cause damage to drainage systems[226]. The plants thrive even when growing in very polluted cities[11, 229] and so have been used as street trees and as shade-trees in parks[268], they do not do well in the north of Britain, however[98].

The leaves contain hydroquinones and are strongly antibacterial, especially against certain organisms associated with urinary infections[238]. The plant should be used with caution, however, because hydroquinones are also toxic[222]. The leaves are antiseptic, astringent, diuretic, lithontripic, hypnotic and tonic[7, 9, 21, 102, 165, 172, 192]. The dried leaves are used in the treatment of a variety of complaints[4]. These leaves should be harvested in early autumn, only green leaves being selected, and then dried in gentle heat[4]. A tea made from the dried leaves is much used for kidney and bladder complaints and inflammations of the urinary tract such as acute and chronic cystitis and urethritis, but it should be used with caution and preferably only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[4, 21, 46, 172, 222, 254]. The tea is more effective if the urine is alkaline, thus it is best used in combination with a vegetable-based diet[254]. Externally, a poultice of the infused leaves with oil has been used as a salve to treat rashes, skin sores etc, and as a wash for a baby's head[257]. An infusion of the leaves has been used as an eyewash, a mouthwash for cankers and sore gums and as a poultice for back pains, rheumatism, burns etc[257]. The dried leaves have been used for smoking as an alternative to tobacco[238]. One report says that it is unclear whether this was for medicinal purposes or for the intoxicated state it could produce[192], whilst another says that the leaves were smoked to treat headaches and also as a narcotic[257]. The herb should not be prescribed to children, pregnant women or patients with kidney disease[238]. Another report says that some native North American Indian tribes used an infusion of the stems, combined with blueberry stems (Vaccinium spp) to prevent miscarriage without causing harm to the baby, and to speed a woman's recovery after the birth[257]. Other uses: fluid retention and bed wetting. Claimed to strengthen the heart muscle and urinary tract and to return the womb to its normal size after childbirth [301].

Prefers a rich loamy soil with plenty of moisture and a sunny position[1, 134, 160]. Full sun to part shade. Pawpaw is shade tolerant and would prefer some afternoon shade from other trees or perhaps the shade of a building. Spreads by root suckers to form colonies, so give it room to spread (nfs.unl.edu). Plants are hardy to about -20Â°c according to one report[184], whilst another says that they are hardy to -35Â°c when fully dormant[160]. The papaw produces a delicious edible fruit which is a potentially commercial crop[61]. The wild-collected fruit is often sold in local markets in America[82]. The tree commences bearing in 4 - 6 years from seed and yields up to 30 kilos per tree[160]. There are some named varieties[183]. The mature fruit is rarely seen in Britain[182], only ripening after a long hot summer[200]. A small tree growing against a south-facing wall at Bristol Botanical Gardens had a small crop of immature fruit in early September 1996 (following the hot summer of 1995) - this was the first time it had been seen to bear fruit[K]. Flowers are formed in the leaf axils of wood produced the previous summer[82, 229]. Established plants resent root disturbance, the best plants are obtained by planting them out into their permanent positions as young as possible though young plants should be given some protection for their first year or two[200]. The leaves emit a heavy unpleasant odour when crushed[82, 229]. Plants are untroubled by pests or diseases[160]. Special Features:North American native, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. \r\nPlant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  \r\nThe Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30Â°C). \r\nAt this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). \r\nFor example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1).

For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The root pattern is a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].

The plant is mainly used nowadays as a tonic to the gallbladder to improve the flow of bile and ameliorate conditions such as gallbladder pain, gallstones and jaundice[254]. The bark and root bark are antiseptic, astringent, cholagogue, hepatic, purgative, refrigerant, stomachic and tonic[4, 7, 9, 21, 46, 165, 222]. The bark is harvested in the summer and can be dried for storing[4]. It is especially useful in cases of jaundice, general debility and biliousness[4], but should be used with caution[165]. The flowers and the stem bark are antirheumatic[218]. The roots are astringent and antiseptic[222]. They have been pulverized in a little water and used to treat mouth ulcers[213]. A tea of the roots and stems has been used to treat stomach ulcers[213]. The root bark has also been used as a purgative and treatment for diarrhoea[213] and is diaphoretic[222]. A tincture of the root bark has been used in the treatment of rheumatism, sciatica etc[222]. The root bark is a rich source of the alkaloid berberine -about 6%[240]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Berberis species, has marked antibacterial effects. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218] and is also effective in the treatment of hypersensitive eyes, inflamed lids and conjunctivitis[244]. A tea made from the fruits is antipruritic, antiseptic, appetizer, astringent, diuretic, expectorant and laxative[7, 222]. It is also used as a febrifuge[213]. The fruit, or freshly pressed juice, is used in the treatment of liver and gall bladder problems, kidney stones, menstrual pains etc[9]. The leaves are astringent and antiscorbutic[7]. A tea made from the leaves is used in the treatment of coughs[222]. The plant (probably the inner bark) is used by homeopaths as a valuable remedy for kidney and liver insufficiency[244].

Trees take 25 - 30 years before they commence bearing seeds and peak production does not begin until they are about 80 years old[229]. Trees thrive in Britain, often bearing fruit[11]. Trees are planted for timber in Germany[50]. Plants are strongly tap-rooted and should be planted in their permanent positions as soon as possible[1, 137]. Sowing in situ would be the best method so long as the seed could be protected from mice[1, 200]. Trees are late coming into leaf (usually late May to June) and lose their leaves early in the autumn (usually in October)[137]. During this time they cast a heavy shade.

Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Most species in this genus have quite a wide range of distribution and, in order to find trees more suited to this country, seed from the most appropriate provenances should be sought[137].

Trees are fairly fast growing[200]. Trees do not grow very well in Britain, requiring hotter summers than are normally experienced here in order to fruit and fully ripen their wood[200]. However, a tree at Cambridge botanical gardens was 20 metres tall in 1985. Trees are said to be hardy to about -12Â°c, the same report also says that they are hardy to zone 5[200], which would experience considerably lower temperatures than this. Trees are probably much hardier when grown in areas with hot summers. In the wild, trees grow best in areas where summer temperatures average 24 - 30Â°c and the humidity is high[229]. Often cultivated for its edible seed, there are some named varieties[183]. Trees come into bearing when about 20 years old, the best period of production being between the ages of 75 to 225 years old[229]. Mature trees regularly give yields of 225 kilos, whilst yields of 450 kilos have been recorded[229]. A number of cultivars have been developed in N.

An early fruiting form with small nuts that have an excellent flavour[183]. \'Gibson\'. Precocious, protandrous, the nuts are of medium size with a good flavour[183]. \'Green Island\'. Amongst the hardiest of cultivars, it has been selected for nut size, flavour and productivity[183]. \'Mullahy\'. Hardy, precocious and very productive, it has ripened in Ontario[183]. Nuts are fairly large with an excellent flavour. \'Voiles 2\'. Usually ripens as far north as Ontario and New York[183].

Succeeds in all but the very poorest acid soils[186]. Once established, it succeeds in excessively moist soils and also tolerates drought[200]. It grows well on a chalk soil and also in heavy clay soils[200]. A position in full sun is best when plants are being grown for their fruit, they also succeed in semi-shade though fruit yields and quality will be lower in such a position[11, 200]. Most members of this genus succeed in exposed positions, they also tolerate atmospheric pollution[200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to at least -18Â°c[202]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus and with C. laevigata in the wild[186, 200]. There are many named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Seedling trees take from 5 - 8 years before they start bearing fruit, though grafted trees will often flower heavily in their third year[K]. The flowers have a foetid smell somewhat like decaying fish. This attracts midges which are the main means of fertilization. When freshly open, the flowers have more pleasant scent with balsamic undertones[245]. Seedlings should not be left in a seedbed for more than 2 years without being transplanted[11]. In heavier shade they quickly become drawn and leggy, eventually dying[186]. An important food plant for the caterpillars of many lepidoptera species[30], there are 149 insect species associated with this tree[24]. Plants are susceptible to fireblight[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].']","[""Seed - this is best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, some of the seed will germinate in the spring, though most will probably take another year. Stored seed can be very slow and erratic to germinate, it should be warm stratified for 3 months at 15Â°c and then cold stratified for another 3 months at 4Â°c[164]. It may still take another 18 months to germinate[78]. Scarifying the seed before stratifying it might reduce this time[80]. Fermenting the seed for a few days in its own pulp may also speed up the germination process[K]. Another possibility is to harvest the seed 'green' (as soon as the embryo has fully developed but before the seedcoat hardens) and sow it immediately in a cold frame. If timed well, it can germinate in the spring[80]. If you are only growing small quantities of plants, it is best to pot up the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in individual pots for their first year, planting them out in late spring into nursery beds or their final positions. When growing larger quantities, it might be best to sow them directly outdoors in a seedbed, but with protection from mice and other seed-eating creatures. Grow them on in the seedbed until large enough to plant out, but undercut the roots if they are to be left undisturbed for more than two years.""]","['Edible Parts:', 'Flowers', 'Fruit', 'Leaves', 'Edible Uses:', 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 12].

It is used mainly for treating disorders of the heart and circulation system, especially angina[254]. Western herbalists consider it a 'food for the heart', it increases the blood flow to the heart muscles and restores normal heart beat[254]. This effect is brought about by the presence of bioflavonoids in the fruit, these bioflavonoids are also strongly antioxidant, helping to prevent or reduce degeneration of the blood vessels[254]. The fruit is antispasmodic, cardiac, diuretic, sedative, tonic and vasodilator[4, 9, 21, 46, 165]. Both the fruits and flowers of hawthorns are well-known in herbal folk medicine as a heart tonic and modern research has borne out this use. The fruits and flowers have a hypotensive effect as well as acting as a direct and mild heart tonic[222]. They are especially indicated in the treatment of weak heart combined with high blood pressure[222], they are also used to treat a heart muscle weakened by age, for inflammation of the heart muscle, arteriosclerosis and for nervous heart problems[21]. Prolonged use is necessary for the treatment to be efficacious[222]. It is normally used either as a tea or a tincture[222]. Hawthorn is combined with ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) to enhance poor memory, working by improving the blood supply to the brain[254].

Plants are somewhat tender when young[11], though dormant mature trees are hardy to about -35Â°c[160]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Dioecious, but the female tree can produce seedless fruits in the absence of a pollinator[1]. It is likely that unfertilized fruits are more astringent than fertilized fruits since this is the case with D. kaki[K]. Trees can start producing fruit when only a few years old, a specimen seen at Kew Botanical gardens in autumn 1996 was only 1.5 metres tall and was bearing a very large crop of fruit[K]. This species is occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit, there are several named varieties[82, 183]. \'Dooley\' grows well near the northern limits of persimmon culture[183]. \'Geneva Red\' also grows well at the northern limits of persimmon culture.

A heavy wet soil tends to encourage excessive plant growth at the expense of fruit production[1]. Prefers a very sunny position but tolerates part-day shade when grown on a warm wall[202]. Plants are hardy to about -15Â°c[202]. The top growth is susceptible to frost damage and can be killed back to the base in severe winters, though plants usually recover well[3]. Trees require the protection of a south or west facing wall in most parts of Britain if they are to produce a worthwhile crop[3, 219], though free standing trees can succeed in Cornwall[59]. There is a small orchard of free-standing trees in Anthony garden near Plymouth. These were seen in July 1995 with a very heavy crop of ripening fruits that would have been ready by August[K]. Figs are very widely cultivated in warmer climes than Britain for their edible fruit, there are many named varieties[183]. 'Brown Turkey' is the cultivar most commonly grown in Britain and is probably the most suitable for this climate. 'White Ischia' is a dwarf cultivar (though it can still be 5 metres tall and wide) and is ideal for pot culture[238]. It produces an abundance of green-white thin-skinned fruits[238]. Up to three crops of fruit a year can be obtained in some countries[46]. When grown outdoors in Britain only one crop is usually obtained, though in exceptionally hot years two crops are sometimes produced. The fruit usually takes about 12 months to mature in Britain, baby fruits no larger than about 15mm long in the autumn usually overwinter to form the following years crop of fruit. If plants are grown in pots in a conservatory or cold greenhouse, two crops of fruit can be obtained, one in early summer and one in late summer to autumn[260]. Pinch back the new shoots to about six leaves in order to encourage the second crop[260]. It is a good idea to restrict the roots of fig trees on most soil types in order to discourage excessive vegetative growth at the expense of fruit production[3]. This can be done by root pruning, but it is easier to place some kind of permanent restriction around the roots - planting into a large tub that is then buried into the ground is one method. It is important to make sure that the tree still gets ample moisture, especially when the fruits are ripening.

Trees are rather tender when young, but they are hardy to about -30Â°c once they are established[200]. They grow best in southern Britain[11]. The honey locust is often cultivated in warm temperate zones for its edible seeds and seedpods[202], trees start to bear when about 10 years old and produce commercial crops for about 100 years[227]. Wild trees seldom live longer than 120 years[229]. Trees are shy to flower and therefore do not often produce a worthwhile crop in Britain due to our cooler summers[202]. There are some named varieties[183]. The sub-species nana produced lots of viable seed in the hot summer of 1989 at Kew[K], it also had a very good crop in 1994, 1996 and in 1999[K].

The bark is astringent, haemostatic, sedative and tonic[4, 14, 21, 165, 171, 222]. Tannins in the bark are believed to be responsible for its astringent and haemostatic properties[222]. Bottled witch hazel water is a steam distillate that does not contain the tannins from the shrub[222], this is less effective in its action than a tincture[238]. The bark is used internally in the treatment of diarrhoea, colitis, dysentery, haemorrhoids, vaginal discharge, excessive menstruation, internal bleeding and prolapsed organs[238]. Branches and twigs are harvested for the bark in the spring[238]. An infusion of the leaves is used to reduce inflammations, treat piles, internal haemorrhages and eye inflammations[213]. The leaves are harvested in the summer and can be dried for later use[238]. A homeopathic remedy is made from fresh bark[232]. It is used in the treatment of nosebleeds, piles and varicose veins[232].']",19033,Hamamelis virginiana,Plantae,Viridiplantae,Streptophyta,Embryophyta,Tracheophyta,Spermatophytina,Magnoliopsida,,Saxifragales,Hamamelidaceae,Hamamelis,Hamamelis virginiana,,,Saxifraganae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ivy is a very easily grown plant that dislikes waterlogged, very dry or very acid soils but otherwise succeeds in all soil types[1, 17, 238]. It grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers some lime in the soil. Tolerates very dense shade[24, 31], though it may not flower in such a position[K]. The plant is very hardy and tolerant of atmospheric pollution[4]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. A very ornamental and hardy plant[190], it tolerates temperatures down to about -25Â°c[184]. There are many named varieties[190], the variegated forms are less hardy than the species and also require more light[238]. Ivy is a rampant climbing plant, clinging by means of aerial roots and often trailing on the ground in woods and hedges[186]. It is of benefit rather than harm when growing on a wall because it keeps the wall dry and acts as an insulation[11, 24]. It does not damage the structure of a wall. Similarly, it does not harm large trees when climbing into them, though it can shade out smaller and ailing trees[200]. It is not a parasitic plant, but instead obtains all its nutrient from the sun and the soil[186]. A very good plant for wild-life, it provides dense shelter for birds, spiders etc, an abundant late supply of nectar for insects and a supply of seeds for winter food[4, 24, 186]. It is a food plant for the larvae of many species of butterfly[24, 30]. A very variable plant, there are many named varieties. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200].

It is often used in folk herbal remedies[218], especially in the treatment of rheumatism and as an external application to skin eruptions, swollen tissue, painful joints, burns and suppurating cuts[9, 238]. Recent research has shown that the leaves contain the compound 'emetine', which is an amoebicidal alkaloid, and also triterpene saponins, which are effective against liver flukes, molluscs, internal parasites and fungal infections[238]. The leaves are antibacterial, antirheumatic, antiseptic, antispasmodic, astringent, cathartic, diaphoretic, emetic, emmenagogue, stimulant, sudorific, vasoconstrictor, vasodilator and vermifuge[7, 218, 238]. The plant is used internally in the treatment of gout, rheumatic pain, whooping cough, bronchitis and as a parasiticide[238]. Some caution is advised if it is being used internally since the plant is mildly toxic[7]. Excessive doses destroy red blood cells and cause irritability, diarrhoea and vomiting[238]. This plant should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. An infusion of the twigs in oil is recommended for the treatment of sunburn[4]. The leaves are harvested in spring and early summer, they are used fresh and can also be dried[9].

The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts[200]. Sometimes cultivated in N. America for its edible seed, there are some named varieties[63, 117, 183]. Trees can come into bearing in 6 - 10 years from seed and fruiting is usually biennial[160]. The trees are quite short-lived, seldom exceeding 80 - 90 years[229]. They require about 105 frost-free days in order to ripen a crop in N. America[160]. Unfortunately, they have not proved successful as a nut tree in Britain, usually failing to produce a crop[11]. This is probably due to our cooler summers[11]. It is sometimes planted as a timber tree in Denmark and Rumania[50]. Plants produce a deep taproot and are intolerant of root disturbance. Seedlings should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and given some protection for their first few winters since they are somewhat tender when young[1, 11].

The dormant plant is very cold hardy, but the young growth in spring, however, can be damaged by late frosts. The Black walnut is one of most valuable natural forest trees in the United States[269]. A very ornamental and fast growing plant[1, 200], it is sometimes cultivated in N. America for its edible seed. Whilst potential yields of 7.5 tonnes per hectare have been postulated, it is more feasible to expect annual yields of around 2.5 tonnes per hectare[269]. Good seed crops are usually produced every other year, though some plants fruit well annually whilst others produce god crops every third year[269]. The average weight of a seed from wild trees is about 17g, though there are many named varieties and the weight of their seeds varies from 20 - 30g[183, 269]. There are breeding programmes that are seeking to develop cultivars with thinner shells[226]. Trees in the wild commence bearing seeds when about 12 years old[227]. Black walnut trees mature their fruit rather generally throughout the plants natural range where there is a growing season of about 150 days and an average summer temperature of 16.5Â°C[269]. Trees do not fruit very freely in Britain unfortunately[1, 11]. They grow well in the eastern half of the country but often do not thrive in the west[98]. Trees have been extensively planted for timber in parts of C. and E. Europe[50]. This species hybridizes with J. regia[149], some named cultivars have been developed from this cross for their seed. Plants produce a deep taproot which makes them very drought resistant when established, though they are intolerant of root disturbance[1, 11, 269]. Seedlings should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and given some protection for their first winter or two since they are somewhat tender when young[1, 11]. Flower initiation depends upon suitable conditions in the previous summer[200]. The flowers and young growths can be destroyed by even short periods down to -2Â°c, but fortunately plants are usually late coming into leaf[200]. The black walnut is self-fertile, but the sequence of male and female blooming, called dichogamy, can and often does minimize chances of a tree shedding pollen on its own pistils. In different trees pollen may be shed before the receptivity period of female flowers, or at same time, or after pistil receptivity. For greatest possible nut production, plant trees of 2 or more cvs, as different cvs have overlapping pollen-receptivity periods and can pollinate each other[269]. Any pruning should only be carried out in late summer to early autumn or when the plant is fully dormant otherwise wounds will bleed profusely and this will severely weaken the tree[200]. Plants produce chemicals which can inhibit the growth of other plants. These chemicals are dissolved out of the leaves when it rains and are washed down to the ground below, reducing the growth of plants under the tree[18, 20, 159]. The roots also produce substances that are toxic to many plant species, especially apples (Malus species), members of the Ericaceae, Potentilla spp and the white pines (certain Pinus spp.)[200]. Beans, peas and tomatoes are also particularly sensitive to these secretions and will not grow in the rooting zone[200]. Trees cast quite a dense shade so, along with their other anti-social tendencies, are not very friendly trees for a woodland garden[K]. The bruised leaves have a pleasant sweet though resinous smell[245]. Special Features:\r\nAttracts birds, North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. \r\nPlant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  \r\nThe Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30Â°C). \r\nAt this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). \r\nFor example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2].

You need to protect it from mice, birds, squirrels etc. The seed usually germinates in late winter or the spring. Plant out the seedlings into their permanent positions in early summer and give some protection from the cold for their first winter or two. The seed can also be stored in cool moist conditions (such s the salad compartment of a fridge) over the winter and sown in early spring but it may then require a period of cold stratification before it will germinate[78, 80, 113].']","['Edible Parts:', 'Oil', 'Sap', 'Seed', 'Edible Uses:', 'Oil', 'Sweetener', 'Seed - raw or cooked.

A north or east aspect is more suitable than west or south[11]. It dislikes growing in wet ground or frost pockets[11, 81], and grows best in areas with abundant rainfall[11]. The larch is a very ornamental tree that is widely grown for forestry[11, 81]. It is very fast growing with new annual growth of 1.5 metres often found and trees can average 60cm or more for many years[185]. The dormant trees are very cold hardy, but they are often excited into premature growth in Britain by mild spells during the winter, the plants are then subject to damage by late frosts and cold winds[1, 185]. The young shoots have a delicate mossy fragrance as the leaves unfold[245]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. Open ground plants, 1 year x 1 year are the best for planting out, do not use container grown plants with spiralled roots[200]. Plants transplant well, even when coming into growth in the spring[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[81, 200].  Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.']","['Seed - sow late winter in pots in a cold frame. One months cold stratification helps germination[113]. It is best to give the seedlings light shade for the first year[78]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots. Although only a few centimetres tall, they can be planted out into their permanent positions in the summer providing you give them an effective weed-excluding mulch and preferably some winter protection for their first year. Otherwise grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year. The seed remains viable for 3 years[113] If you are growing larger quantities of plants, you can sow the seed in an outdoor seedbed in late winter. Grow on the seedlings in the seedbed for a couple of years until they are ready to go into their permanent positions then plant them out during the winter.']","['Edible Parts:', 'Inner bark', 'Manna', 'Edible Uses:', ""Inner bark - it can be eaten raw or can be dried, ground into a powder and used with cereal flours in making bread etc[2, 177].

A cold extract of the bark is used as a laxative[9]. As an external application, it is useful in the treatment of chronic eczema and psoriasis[4]. The powdered bark can be used on purulent and difficult wounds to promote their healing[21]. The bark is harvested in the spring and should be dried rapidly[4]. The turpentine obtained from the resin is antiseptic, balsamic, diuretic, haemostatic, rubefacient and vermifuge[4, 238].

Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing canoes, containers etc, as a wood preservative etc[257]. Wood - straight and close-grained, light, soft, not strong, works easily and takes an excellent natural or painted finish[46, 61, 82, 171, 226, 229]. It weighs 24lb per cubic foot[235].

The white pine is a very important timber crop in its native range, the huge stands that existed before the Europeans went to N. America have been largely cut down[229]. It is a fast-growing and fairly long-lived tree[229] that is often cultivated as a timber tree, especially in central Europe[50]. Young trees grow very vigorously with new shoots of up to 1 metre common. Growth slows and almost ceases by the time the tree is 20 metres tall[185]. Trees can produce cones when 5 - 10 years old, but reliable seed production takes another 10 years[229]. Good crops are produced every 3 - 5 years in the wild, with little seed in the intervening years[229]. The cones are 10 - 20cm long and take 2 years to mature[82, 229], they open and shed their seed in late summer whilst still attached to the tree[82, 226]. Plants often self-sow in Britain[185]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Trees have a very thin bark, which makes them particularly susceptible to forest fires[226]. This species is very susceptible to white pine blister rust, it should not be grown near any gooseberries or currants (Ribes species) since these plants can act as vectors for the disease[1, 120]. Plants are also subject to aphid damage[1]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].

Requires shelter from north and north-east winds[11] and also from spring frosts[200]. Widely cultivated for its edible fruit in warm temperate areas and continental climates, there are many named varieties[183]. There are numerous divisions of the varieties according to skin colour etc. Perhaps the most useful from the eaters point of view is whether it is free-stone (the flesh parts easily from the seed) or cling-stone (the flesh adheres to the seed)[200, K]. Trees are normally hardy in southern Britain[11], tolerating temperatures down to about -20Â°c when they are dormant[184], but they require some protection if cropping is to be at all reliable[11]. This is not due so much to lack of cold hardiness, more to the cooler summers in Britain which do not fully ripen the wood and the fruit, plus the unpredictable winters and springs which, in a mild spell, can excite the tree into premature flowering and growth which is then very liable to damage in any following cold spell. Hand pollination at this time can improve fruit-set[200]. The cultivar \'Rochester\' is more likely than most cultivars to succeed outdoors in Britain[200]. In general it is best to site peaches in a very warm sheltered sunny position, preferably against a south or west facing wall[200, 219]. Most cultivars are self-fertile[200]. Trees are often grafted onto plum or other rootstocks but are said to be better when grown on their own roots in southern Britain[11]. Trees are not generally long-lived[200], this is partly because of the need for the tree to produce a constant supply of new wood since most fruit is formed on one-year old wood (though some fruit spurs are formed)[200]. Garlic is a good companion for this plant, helping to prevent disease, especially peach leaf curl[20, 201]. Tansy grown below peach trees helps to keep them healthier[201]. Peach leaf curl can also be prevented by protecting the plants from winter and early spring rains, perhaps by covering them in plastic[200]. Plants grown or overwintered indoors do not suffer from leaf curl[260]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:\r\nEdible, Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. \r\nPlant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  \r\nThe Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30Â°C). \r\nAt this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). \r\nFor example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots spreading near the soil surface. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from runners away from the plant [2-1].']","['Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200].

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 18 - 28Â°c, but can tolerate 9 - 32Â°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -6Â°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at -1Â°c[418 ]. Plants are hardy to about -15Â°c, they can resprout from the base if they are cut down by frosts[200 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,200 - 1,400mm, but tolerates 950 - 2,200mm[418 ]. Succeeds in most well-drained soils in a sunny position[200 ], though it does not make good growth on very light poor sand or on poorly drained heavy clay[269 ]. Grows best on well-drained loam soil of good fertility[269 ]. Plants cannot stand waterlogging on any soil[269 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 5 - 7.1[269 , 418 ]. A deep-rooted pant, once established it is very drought resistant[171 , 269 ]. When grown in warm climates, the root can be invasive and plants have become weeds[182 , 219 ]. Introduced into the southern N. American states in 1876 as a soil stabilizer, the plant has spread very widely (it can grow up to 30cm in a day), and has swamped out native vegetation, including large trees. It is considered to be one of the most obnoxious weeds in that region[274 ]. The tubers can be harvested about 1 year after planting, if grown from cuttings. If left longer in the soil they can become very large, with weights of up to 180 kilos[303 ]. Pueraria montana has three varieties. The form Pueraria montana lobata (Willd.) Sanjappa & Pradeep (formerly known as Pueraria lobata) is the form most commonly mentioned for its medicinal and other uses. The other varieties should be very similar in their applications[K ]. The flowers have a sweet vanilla scent[245 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ].']","['Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow in a warm greenhouse in early spring.

Recent research has shown that compounds called 'daidzin' and 'daidzein', which are contained in the roots and the flowers, are a safe and effective method for treating alcohol abuse[238 ]. They work by suppressing the appetite for alcohol, whereas existing treatments interfere with the way the alcohol is metabolised and can cause a build-up of toxins[238 ]. The plant is often used in combination with Chrysanthemum x morifolium in treating alcohol abuse[254 ]. The flowers and the roots are antidote, antiemetic, antipyretic, antispasmodic, demulcent, diaphoretic, digestive, febrifuge, hypoglycaemic and hypotensive[174 , 176 , 218 , 222 , 238 ].

Its main use has been in the rehabilitation of former surface mine sites and for erosion control, but it is also used to rehabilitate contaminated soils, depleted soils, gravel pits, and logged areas, and to stabilize railroad embankments and highway edges[1050\r\n\r\n].\r\nThe plant is often found as a pioneer on old fields, burned areas, and lands strip-mined for coal[418\r\n\r\n].\r\nThe leaves are rich in tannin and other substances which inhibit the growth of other plants[13\r\n\r\n].\r\nThe flowers are a rich source of nectar.

The dried stem, usually collected in the autumn and preferably from the ends of branches 2 - 3 years old, is the part that is most valued medicinally, though the leaves are also used[4]. The plant is chiefly used as an alterative when taken internally in the treatment of a range of skin diseases, it is also used in the treatment of arthritis, rheumatism, bronchial congestion, heart ailments, ulcerative colitis and jaundice[4, 218, 238]. Externally, the plant is used to treat skin eruptions, ulcers, rheumatism and cellulite[238]. Two to three year old stems are harvested in the spring, or after the leaves have fallen in the autumn, and dried for later use[238]. The fruits are marinated in vinegar and applied to cancerous sores and other swellings[218]. A decoction of the root is used in the treatment of cancer and swellings[218]. The root is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[238]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the fresh, green, still pliant stems and leaves, harvested as the plant begins to flower[232]. This is used in treating a variety of complaints including backaches, cough, diarrhoea, eye inflammations and joint pains[232].

Bark beetles and root grafting by adjacent trees allow the fungus to enter the vascular systems of the trees. The trees react with defense mechanisms that further constrict the flow of water and nutrients, further weakening the trees. Eventually, life cannot be sustained. Dutch elm disease was first discovered in Ohio and has since spread all across North America, except for arid areas of the U.S. southwest. The disease can be treated (but not cured) through the stem injection of fungicides. A few dutch elm disease resistant varieties are available for planting including âValley Forge, âPrincetonâ and âJeffersonâ.","Ulmus: Latin name /

Trees have been over-exploited in the wild, plus they have also suffered from Dutch elm disease. As a result they are becoming much less common[238]. The slippery elm is very susceptible to 'Dutch elm disease', a disease that has destroyed the greater part of all the elm trees growing in Britain. The disease is spread by means of beetles. There is no effective cure (1992) for the problem, but most E. Asian, though not Himalayan, species are resistant (though not immune) to the disease so the potential exists to use these resistant species to develop new resistant hybrids with the native species[200].

The inner bark is harvested in the spring from the main trunk and from larger branches, it is then dried and powdered for use as required[4]. Ten year old bark is said to be best[4]. Fine grades of the powder are best for internal use, coarse grades are better suited to poultices[238]. The plant is also part of a North American formula called essiac which is a popular treatment for cancer. Its effectiveness has never been reliably proven or disproven since controlled studies have not been carried out. The other herbs included in the formula are Arctium lappa, Rumex acetosella and Rheum palmatum[254]. The inner bark is demulcent, diuretic, emollient, expectorant, nutritive[4, 21, 165, 213].

Modern research has confirmed this use, the seeds being used to restore balanced functioning to the female reproductive system[254]. The seeds and fruits are anaphrodisiac, aphrodisiac, galactogogue, ophthalmic, sedative, stomachic, women's complaints[89, 148, 165]. Prolonged usage restores corpus luteum function[165]. Unfortunately, the berries are unlikely to be produced in the British climate[K]. The berries of this plant have a range of medicinal actions but possibly the most important is its ability to rectify hormonal imbalances caused by an excess of oestrogen and an insufficiency of progesterone[224]. It acts upon the pituitary gland, reducing the production of certain hormones and increasing the production of others, shifting the balance in favour of the gestagens. Thus it has a wide application of uses in malfunctions of the feminine reproductive system and has been used with great effect in restoring absent menstruation, regulating heavy periods, restoring fertility when this is caused by hormonal imbalance, relieving pre-menstrual tension and easing the change of the menopause[224]. Some caution is advised since excessive doses can cause a nervous disorder known as formication, which manifests as a sensation of insects crawling over the skin[238]. The berries are considered to be an aphrodisiac[89], though other reports say that they are anaphrodisiac[11, 46]. The reason for this apparent disagreement is that the berries have a regulating effect on the body and so are likely to increase sexual activity in those who are not very active in this area whilst reducing it in those who are very active[K]. The fresh berries are pounded to a pulp and used in the form of a tincture for the relief of paralysis, pains in the limbs, weakness etc[4]. Other uses include: reduced flatulence, suppress appetite and induce sleep. Unproven uses include: treatment of impotence, prostatitis, swelling of the testes, sterility, swelling of the ovaries[301]. Not recommended during pregnancy and could inhibit milk production[301].

Prefers a good loamy soil in a sunny south or south-west facing position, sheltered from cold winds and from early morning sun on frosty mornings[11, 200]. Plants can become chlorotic on alkaline soils[200]. A soil that is too rich results in excessive foliage at the expense of flowering[200]. Although they are winter hardy to about -20Â°c[200], when growing in areas with cool summers the plants require the extra summer warmth of a sunny wall if they are to do well[184]. Plants can take a few years to settle down after planting out[219]. Too much shade or too rich a soil are normally the culprits, some form of root restriction can be beneficial[219].

The flowers have a strong perfume which can be sweet or musty according to the variety being grown[249]. The plants flower mainly on short spurs so, if removing unwanted side-branches, it is best to cut them back to 2 - 3 leaves rather than removing them completely since this will encourage the formation of flowering spurs[249]. Any drastic pruning is best carried out in the spring, immediately after flowering[249]. Plants are very tolerant of even the most drastic pruning and will re-grow even if cut right back to the base[249]. Plants are self-fertile and usually produce good crops of seeds in cultivation, there are several cultivars such as 'Geisha' and 'Royal Purple' that are particularly good at this[249]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. The plants also form a symbiotic relationship with a mycorrhizal fungus which makes more water, phosphorus and other minerals available to the plants[249].

Prefers a good loamy soil in a sunny south or south-west facing position, sheltered from cold winds and from early morning sun on frosty mornings[11, 200]. Succeeds in partial shade. Plants can become chlorotic on alkaline soils[200]. A soil that is too rich results in excessive foliage at the expense of flowering[200]. Hardy to about -15Â°c[184, 200]. Plants can take a few years to settle down after planting out[219]. Too much shade or too rich a soil are normally the culprits, some form of root restriction can be beneficial[219]. There are several named forms selected for their ornamental value[188]. Sparrows and other birds frequently eat the young buds of this plant and this is the commonest cause of poor flowering on established plants[184]. Plants sometimes have a second season of flowering in August[219]. The plants flower mainly on short spurs so, if removing unwanted side-branches, it is best to cut them back to 2 - 3 leaves rather than removing them completely since this will encourage the formation of flowering spurs[249]. Any drastic pruning is best carried out in the spring, immediately after flowering[249]. Plants are very tolerant of even the most drastic pruning and will re-grow even if cut right back to the base[249]. A climbing plant supporting itself by twining around other plants, the shoots twine in an anticlockwise direction[182]. Very tolerant of pruning, plants can regenerate from old wood[202]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Closely related to W. floribunda[126]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. The plants also form a symbiotic relationship with a mycorrhizal fungus which makes more water, phosphorus and other minerals available to the plants[249].

They produce arterial excitement and are of use in the treatment of fevers, ague, poor circulation etc[4]. The fruits are considered more active than the bark, they are also antispasmodic, carminative, diuretic and antirheumatic[4, 213, 222]. The pulverized root and bark are used to ease the pain of toothache[213, 222]. One report says that it is very efficacious, but the sensation of the acrid bark is fully as unpleasant as the toothache[213]. Chewing the bark induces copious salivation[222]. Rubbing the fruit against the skin, especially on the lips or in the mouth, produces a numbing effect[K]. A tea or tincture of the bark has been used in the treatment of rheumatism, dyspepsia, dysentery, heart and kidney troubles etc[222]. A tea made from the inner bark has been used to treat itchy skin[213, 257].']",505788,Zanthoxylum americanum,Plantae,Viridiplantae,Streptophyta,Embryophyta,Tracheophyta,Spermatophytina,Magnoliopsida,,Sapindales,Rutaceae,Zanthoxylum,Zanthoxylum americanum,,,Rosanae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
