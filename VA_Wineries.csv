Owners Dean and Nancy Vanhuss, with their daughter Michelle Pizzarello, have carefully restored it, using nearly all of the original wood to keep the spirit of the stable intact and give the winery a distinct rustic feel. Exposed wood beams, a tin roof, sconces, and a fireplace give the winery an updated and warm feeling. The original large wooden storm shutters now slide past the winery's French doors, and the loft has two balconies overlooking the attractive grounds. The patio seats up to 30 people for wine tasting and light fare.  For Dean Vanhuss, winemaking is a retirement venture after a career in technology. He has been growing grapes in Loudoun since the late 1990s and currently has six acres planted, most at Short Hill Vineyards, their home in Lovettsville.","(39.112621, -77.603022)","['Mon: Closed', 'Tues: 12:00 PM - 5:00 PM', 'Wed: 12:00 PM - 5:00 PM', 'Thurs: 12:00 PM - 5:00 PM', 'Fri: 12:00 PM - 7:00 PM', 'Sat: 11:00 AM - 6:00 PM', 'Sun: Closed', 'Bu: s', 'Child: Friendly', 'Food: Available: Light Fare', 'Pet: Friendly', 'Picnic: Area', 'Private: Parties', 'Tasting: Room', 'Weddings:  ', 'Wine: Shop', 'Loudoun: Wine Trail', 'Tuski: e']",Tour Fee: $12 or $15,"['Features', 'Bus/RV Parking', 'Child Friendly', 'Food Available', 'Light Fare', 'Pet Friendly', 'Picnic Area', 'Private Parties', 'Tasting Room', 'Weddings', 'Wine Shop']","[('Loudoun Wine Trail', 'https://www.visitloudoun.org\n'), (""Tuskie's Wine Trail"", 'http://www.tuskies.com/WineTrail/')]",['Virginia']

Originally from Michigan, the Schornbergs chose Virginia to pursue their dream of owning a vineyard after an extensive search that spanned coast to coast.  Al recalls his grandfather’s stories of working at his uncle’s winery, Massena Cellars in France, and like his predecessor, his goal was straightforward: “I just wanted to be able to enjoy a really good wine that I made. There’s something very natural and satisfying about that.”  With their first vintage in 2002 winning the honor of ""Best White Wine in America"" at the Atlanta International Wine Summit, the Schornbergs knew they had made the right decision and set out to prove Virginia could also produce award-winning reds.  In 2009 they were awarded the Virginia Governor's Cup for their 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon, further transforming their dream into a reality.  Now, in 2016 Keswick Vineyards received their second Virginia Governor's Cup for their 2014 Cabernet Franc Reserve.  The Schornbergs are humbled and excited that their vision has evolved into a world-class vineyard and winery, with each year's vintage better than the last.
