Bedan des Parts cider apple tree,"Malus domestica 'Bedan des Parts'
Bedan des Parts is a traditional French hard-cider variety, widely-grown in the cider-producing region of Normandy. It produces a good quality bittersweet juice, usually blended with other varieties.
The apples are typically harvested towards the end of November, when the skin has turned from yellow-green to golden-orange.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Bedan des Parts cider apple tree is back in stock.
In traditional French orchards production on mature trees will be in the range 30-35 tonnes per hectare, which is above average for French cider varieties.
Bedan flowers very late - towards the end of May or early June. This makes it a good choice for areas prone to late frosts, but you will need other late-blooming apple varieties nearby to help with pollination.
Bedan is regarded as susceptible to fireblight and scab in French orchards. However the mild temperate climate of north-western France is quite different to the continental climate of much of the USA, where it appears to have some resistance to fireblight.

It is not the easiest of varieties to grow, but it produces a very high quality bittersweet juice.

Binet Rouge is a weak-growing but relatively heavy-cropping variety, and well-known as a biennial bearer. It is important to prevent it setting too much fruit in the ""on"" year.
In traditional French orchards production on mature trees will be in the range 20-30 tonnes per hectare, which is slightly below the average for French cider varieties.
Binet Rouge flowers over a long period and is a useful pollinator of other varieties.

Bramley's Seedling apple tree,"Bramley's Seedling is an outstanding English ""cooker"", and an essential variety for anyone interested in cooking with apples.
The reason for its versatility in the kitchen is its very high acid content, which is far higher than most traditional American cooking apples. As a result it readily cooks down to a stiff but light apple puree, which is regarded as a key requirement in English apple cookery. When cooked it has an excellent tangy sharp flavor which few other apples can match.
The copious juice also makes Bramley's Seedling valuable for juicing.  In English cider production it is used as a ""sharp"", to increase the acidity of cider blends.
Bramley's Seedling trees are well-known for being long-lived. The first tree was grown from a pip in a garden in Nottinghamshire, England, in 1809 - and amazingly this tree still survives.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Bramley's Seedling apple tree is back in stock.
Bramley's Seedling is a very vigorous triploid variety - it has three sets of chromosomes rather than the more usual two. Its triploid nature can be seen in the strong dark-coloured leaves, thick branches, and large apples. Bramley's Seedling is quite easy to grow, its great vigour and natural disease resistance means it usually throws off problems fairly easily.
As a triploid variety, Bramley's Seedling is not able to pollinate other apple varieties, but ironically it has attractive and prolific pink-flushed blossom. The fruit ripens late in the season, and stores very well.
Bramley's Seedling is one of the best English apples for growing in North America. Although it thrives in the cool temperate climate of an English summer, it is just as happy in hotter continental climates.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Bramley's Seedling was was raised from a pip by a young girl, Mary Ann Brailsford, near Nottingham, England, in 1809. The house, with the mature tree in the garden, was later sold to a Matthew Bramley who allowed cuttings to be propagated as long as his name was used. The original tree still survives - and can be seen in a video made by the BBC in 2011 (note the typical English summer weather!).
The new variety was quickly recognised as an outstanding cooking apple and by the end of the Victorian era it was widely planted in England and Northern Ireland, becoming synonymous with English apple cookery. However for the next century it remained little-known outside the UK, since European and North American growers had long preferred dual-purpose apples which could be both eaten fresh and cooked. Latterly with a resurgence in interest in apple cookery it has become well-known amongst North American apple enthusiasts and, 200 years after its birth, this remarkable ""cooker"" is increasingly recognized as one of the world's great apples varieties.",Sharper,"(4) -30F / -34C, (5) -20F / -29C, (6) -10F / -23C, (7) 0F / -18C, (8) 10F / -12C, (9) 20F / -7C, (10) 30F / -1C","Cool ( 20-24C / 68-75F), Warm (25-30C / 76-85F), Hot (>30C / 86F), Cold (< 20C / 67F)",United Kingdom,Average,Not self-fertile,3.0,"Culinary, Juice, Hard cider, Traditional cooker",Late,Heavy,3 months or more,Poor,Triploid,"Slightly large, Very vigorous",Precocious,Regular,Partial tip-bearer,,Some resistance,Very resistant,1800 - 1849,Green / Red,Large,,Some resistance,Puree,Pale yellow,Normal ripening,Some resistance,Some susceptibility,RHS Award of Garden Merit,,,Apple Cider tree

Geneva Tremlett's cider apple tree,"Malus domestica 'Geneva Tremlett's'

It produces a high quality bittersharp juice, which is useful for blending with other varieties.
As with many old English cider apples, picking takes place very late in the fall.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Geneva Tremlett's cider apple tree is back in stock.
Customers may wonder if there is any relation between the Geneva Tremlett's variety that we sell here, and the traditional English cider variety called Tremlett's Bitter. The answer is there is no relation, and crucially for cider-making purposes, the Geneva Tremlett's is a bittersharp whereas the English variety is a bittersweet.
Nevertheless there is an unusual connection between these two varieties! For many years the USDA at Geneva, NY, maintained scionwood of the original English Tremlett's Bitter, and this was supplied to nurseries throughout the USA who wished to propagate this well-known English cider variety. However it recently came to light that this scionwood had been mis-cataloged, and was not the English Tremlett's Bitter.

The differences are quite obvious - compare our photo, top, with this photo used on our UK sister site. Note the more pointed shape of the English variety. (Sorry, we cannot ship trees from the UK to the USA because of phytosanitary restrictions).
However the ""Geneva Tremlett's"" or ""false Tremlett's"" has proved to be a good quality bittersharp cider variety in its own right (not bittersweet like the original) , and if you are looking for a bittersharp variety for your cider blends it is a good candidate.
The true identification of the Geneva Tremlett's has not been confirmed, but one possibility is that the Geneva variety is actually Skyrme's Kernel, another old English cider variety from the county of Herefordshire, rated by the Victorian pomologist Robert Hogg as ""A favourite cider apple in Herefordshire; quite in the first rank"".",Bittersharp (cider),,,United Kingdom,Average,Not self-fertile,4.0,Hard cider,Very late,,2-3 weeks,Average,Diploid,Average vigour,,,Spur-bearer,,,,1850 - 1899,Yellow / Red,Small,,,,,,,,,,,Apple Cider tree
Harrison cider apple tree,"Harrison is quite unusual, an American apple variety that was grown primarily for cider (hard or sweet).

Stoke Red has generally good disease resistance and is fairly easy to grow. The main issue is that it blooms very late. This is useful in northern areas where late frosts can be a problem, but make sure you have a suitable pollinator variety.
Stoke Red can also lapse into biennial bearing, in other words bearing a crop only every other year. This can be avoided by ensuring that the fruitlets are thinned in early June to prevent over-cropping, which is often the trigger for a poor crop the following year.

Like a number of traditional English and French cider varieties, Vilberie is very late-blooming - in southern England or northern France it will typically flower in the last week of May. This can make cross-pollination an issue unless you have other late-flowering varieties available, although it seems to have reasonable self-fertility.
