"Akane apple tree","Apple tree","
One of the best early-season apples, Akane is a marriage between the American Jonathan apple and the English Worcester Pearmain. In appearance it most closely resembles the Worcester Pearmain. For an early apple variety it has an unusually good balanced flavor, reflecting the influence of the high quality Jonathan.
Akane ripens late August - early September. Like most early varieties the apples do not keep that long, however they hang on the tree rather than falling and cropping can therefore take place over a number of weeks. For the best flavor leave to ripen fully. Akane can also be used for summer apple cookery, slices will keep their shape when cooked.
We do not produce that many Akane trees, but if we are out of stock, try one of its close relatives, Sansa.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Akane apple tree is back in stock.
Akane is not a heavy cropper, but it is generally reliable. It is quite precocious and it comes into bearing on the more dwarf rootstocks after 2-3 years.
Fruit size can be small - it is a good idea to thin the fruitlets in late spring to encourage fewer / larger apples. This will also improve the flavor.
Akane can be considered a low-chill variety and is therefore suitable for warm climates up to USDA zone 9.

"Almata apple tree","Apple tree","
Malus domestica 'Almata'
Almata is a red-fleshed apple variety closely related to the red-fleshed crab-apple Malus niedzwetzkyana. The apples are dark red, with a soft red flesh, producing a pink juice. The blossom is dark pink, the leaves are a dull bronze-green color, and even the wood has a pink stained appearance.
The apples ripen early in the season and do not keep.
The flavor is poor, not really suitable for eating fresh.
Despite these poor characteristics Almata has proven quite popular because of its apparent health benefits - the anthocyanin pigments which give the apple its distinctive dark red appeance are rich in anti-oxidants.

"Baldwin apple tree","Apple tree","
Baldwin is an antique American apple which is still popular today. William Kendrick in his book the New American Orchardist (1833) states it is ""recommended for extensive cultivation"". The Victorian pomologist Robert Hogg stated Baldwin was ""considered one of the finest apples in the Northern States of America"".
It has the key element of a good apple - a balanced flavor (which is predominantly sweet). Baldwin is crisp to eat fresh, but is primarily an apple for the kitchen, where it keeps its shape when cooked. It also produces a sweet juice, with a fruity flavor.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Baldwin apple tree is back in stock.
As you might guess from the size of the apples and the vigor of the tree, Baldwin is a triploid variety - it needs two other (each different) compatible apple varieties nearby to pollinate it (or a single self-fertile variety) and will not pollinate other varieties. It is therefore not a good choice as your only apple tree, but works well as part of a small collection of apple trees.
William Kendrick, cited above, also noted Baldwin's tendency to fall into a cycle of biennial bearing. ""The tree bears enormously every other year, and in the interval, occasionally a moderate crop."" This is easily remedied by heavily thinning in the ""on"" year, and you can also prevent it happening by thinning the fruitlets after the blossom has finished if you notice a particularly heavy fruit set.
Baldwin is an apple for the cooler states, and is most at home in the climate of New England and similar areas,
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
This variety was originally known as the Butters Apple, after a farmer, Mr Butters of Wilmington MA in whose field the original tree was discovered - probably in the 1750s. Mr Butters also called it Woodpecker, on account of the woodpecker birds that frequented the tree.
It is thought to have become known as the Baldwin apple after a Colonel Baldwin, who fought in the Revolutionary War. His troops were resting in a field near Wilmington, MA, and he asked the farmer, Mr Butters, if they could pick apples from a nearby tree. Colonel Baldwin was very taken with the flavor of the apples, and after the war he returned to the farm and asked for cuttings from the tree so that he could grow them himself.","Late","Eating fresh, Culinary, Juice","Good","3 months or more","Sweeter",,,"Normal ripening","Some susceptibility","Keeps shape","Experienced","Not self-fertile",4,"Poor","Triploid","Vigorous","Slow to start bearing","Biennial tendency","Spur-bearer",,"Average","Some susceptibility","Some susceptibility","Some susceptibility","Very resistant",,,"(4) -30F / -34C, (5) -20F / -29C, (6) -10F / -23C, (7) 0F / -18C, (8) 10F / -12C, (9) 20F / -7C, (10) 30F / -1C","Cool ( 20-24C / 68-75F), Warm (25-30C / 76-85F), Hot (>30C / 86F)",,,"United States","1750 - 1799","Orange flush",,

"Bramley's Seedling apple tree","Apple tree","
Bramley's Seedling is an outstanding English ""cooker"", and an essential variety for anyone interested in cooking with apples.
The reason for its versatility in the kitchen is its very high acid content, which is far higher than most traditional American cooking apples. As a result it readily cooks down to a stiff but light apple puree, which is regarded as a key requirement in English apple cookery. When cooked it has an excellent tangy sharp flavor which few other apples can match.
The copious juice also makes Bramley's Seedling valuable for juicing.  In English cider production it is used as a ""sharp"", to increase the acidity of cider blends.
Bramley's Seedling trees are well-known for being long-lived. The first tree was grown from a pip in a garden in Nottinghamshire, England, in 1809 - and amazingly this tree still survives.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Bramley's Seedling apple tree is back in stock.
Bramley's Seedling is a very vigorous triploid variety - it has three sets of chromosomes rather than the more usual two. Its triploid nature can be seen in the strong dark-coloured leaves, thick branches, and large apples. Bramley's Seedling is quite easy to grow, its great vigour and natural disease resistance means it usually throws off problems fairly easily.
As a triploid variety, Bramley's Seedling is not able to pollinate other apple varieties, but ironically it has attractive and prolific pink-flushed blossom. The fruit ripens late in the season, and stores very well.
Bramley's Seedling is one of the best English apples for growing in North America. Although it thrives in the cool temperate climate of an English summer, it is just as happy in hotter continental climates.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Bramley's Seedling was was raised from a pip by a young girl, Mary Ann Brailsford, near Nottingham, England, in 1809. The house, with the mature tree in the garden, was later sold to a Matthew Bramley who allowed cuttings to be propagated as long as his name was used. The original tree still survives - and can be seen in a video made by the BBC in 2011 (note the typical English summer weather!).
The new variety was quickly recognised as an outstanding cooking apple and by the end of the Victorian era it was widely planted in England and Northern Ireland, becoming synonymous with English apple cookery. However for the next century it remained little-known outside the UK, since European and North American growers had long preferred dual-purpose apples which could be both eaten fresh and cooked. Latterly with a resurgence in interest in apple cookery it has become well-known amongst North American apple enthusiasts and, 200 years after its birth, this remarkable ""cooker"" is increasingly recognized as one of the world's great apples varieties.

"Cortland apple tree","Apple tree","
Cortland was one of the first varieties to be developed from the popular McIntosh apple.  It is a cross between an old southern variety, Ben Davis, pollinated by McIntosh.  However as is often the case with McIntosh crosses, Cortland is very much in the McIntosh mould, with the characteristic crimson red skin and glistening sweet white flesh, although it does have a more rustic appeal than some other Mac crosses.
Cortland is a reliable and heavy-cropping variety.  The apples are generally larger than McIntosh, but the sweet perfumed flavor is similar.  Fruit quality from markets can be quite variable because Cortland does not keep especially well, but this is easily remedied by growing your own.  Although primarily an apple for eating fresh, Cortland is also useful in the kitchen, and cut slices don't brown quickly.

"Court Pendu Plat apple tree","Apple tree","
Court Pendu Plat is one of the oldest known apples, dating back to the 1600s and possibly earlier
It has an attractive bi-colored red/orange flushed skin, and the flattened (""plat"") shape is quite distinctive.
The flesh is quite dense. The flavor is aromatic with a noticeable fruity peardrop overtone, making it useful in cider blends.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Court Pendu Plat apple tree is back in stock.
The key characteristic of Court Pendu Plat is its very late blooming, which makes it useful for areas with late spring frosts, and for cross-pollinating with other late-blooming varieties.
Court Pendu Plat is cold hardy and, as is often the case with very old apple varieties, has naturally good disease resistance.

"Cox's Orange Pippin apple tree","Apple tree","
This is the classic English apple, often regarded as the finest of all apples. It sets the benchmark for flavor in apples to which all others aspire. The aromatic complexity and depth of flavors in a good Cox's Orange Pippin are remarkable. In our personal experience pear, melon, freshly-squeezed orange juice, and mango are all readily evident in a good example.
Cox's Orange Pippin is a mid/late season variety and is probably at its best if picked when fully ripe, or picked slightly under-ripe and left in storage for a month or so - it is not a long-keeper though.
Although primarily considered a variety for eating fresh, Cox is an excellent apple for juice / cider blends as well. It is also a versatile culinary apple, with an inherently sweet flavor when baked, and is a common ingredient in English apple preserves, chutneys, and mincemeat.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Cox's Orange Pippin apple tree is back in stock.
The main issue with growing Cox's Orange Pippin is its relatively poor disease resistance. It can be grown without any treatments but cropping may then be lighter - which is not necessarily a bad thing because lighter crops sometimes develop better flavor.
Although forever associated with England, Cox can be grown in warm climates, and indeed seems to do better in warmer and drier conditions than are generally found in England. However enthusiasts believe (with some justification) that the unique flavor can only be fully developed in the marginal climate of a typical English summer. In North America that means Cox's Orange Pippin does best in the cooler zones. See our article on growing English apples in North America for further advice.
The bottom line is that if you are serious about apples then you absolutely must try growing Cox's Orange Pippin, because it is the benchmark for apple flavor.

"CrimsonTopazTM apple tree","Apple tree","
Topaz is a mid-season scab-resistant apple variety with a good balanced sweet-sharp flavor.
CrimsonTopaz is essentially an orange-flushed apple, but will readily color-up to a crimson red in climates with sunny fall days and cool nights.
The apples will hang on the tree and can be picked over an extended period. Alternatively, this is a great variety for deer and birds, and the apples will readily stay on the tree until late December.

CrimsonCrisp is a modern scab-resistant apple. The skin has a yellow background, but predominantly dark crimson red.
As the name suggests, the flesh is very crisp, juicy and snaps cleanly, but not dense.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when CrimsonCrisp apple tree is back in stock.
A particular feature of CrimsonCrisp is that the apples will hang on the tree for a very long time - up to 4 weeks - whilst maintaining eating quality. This makes it ideal for the backyard orchard as you can pick fresh apples straight from the tree over a long period. The apples can be kept for several months in a refrigerator or cold garage, retaining good eating quality although the flavor will fade somewhat.
CrimsonCrisp is field-immune to apple scab disease, but has some susceptibility to fireblight.

"Cripps Pink apple tree","Apple tree","
Cripps Pink is an attractive modern apple variety from Australia. Its distinctive pink/red color and pleasant flavor make it an interesting variety for the gardener or home orchardist. The blossom is also notably attractive.
Although normally considered a variety for eating fresh, Cripps Pink is a good stewing apple - the dense chewy flesh softens nicely with cooking. It also produces a good plain apple juice with a primarily sweet flavor.
Cripps Pink is a good choice for apple growers in the southern states, as it is well-suited to areas with high summer temperatures and low winter-chill hours.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Cripps Pink apple tree is back in stock.
The key point about growing Cripps Pink is the climate of its birthplace - Western Australia. It likes long hot summers and the apples ripen very late in the season. Cripps Pink also has a low winter-chill requirement, and retains its leaves well into the winter - a characteristic usually associated with tropical rather than temperate trees. In short this is a variety that is very well suited to the southern states.
Commercial growers get the maximum pink coloring by removing the topmost leaves in autumn to let the sunlight on to the apples, but home growers may find the pink color soon turns to a (nevertheless very attractive) flecked red color.
Cripps Pink is of average or weak vigour in cooler climates but may be more vigorous in warmer climates. It is susceptible to fireblight.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Cripps Pink was developed in the late 20th century in Western Australia. It is a cross between Golden Delicious and another Australian variety, Lady Williams. It is probably from Lady Williams that it gets its distinct coloring.","Very late","Eating fresh, Juice","Good","3 months or more","Sweet/Sharp",,,"Persistent",,,"Average","Not self-fertile",3,"Average","Diploid","Average vigour",,"Regular","Partial tip-bearer",,"Average","Some susceptibility","Some susceptibility","Very susceptible","Very susceptible",,,"(5) -20F / -29C","Warm (25-30C / 76-85F), Hot (>30C / 86F)","Low-chill",,"Australia","1950 - 1999","Pink",,

"Duchess of Oldenburg apple tree","Apple tree","
Duchess of Oldenburg is a popular early-season apple, primarily used as a cooking apple although it can be eaten fresh when fully ripe. It is often known simply as ""Duchess"".
It is easy to grow, and therefore a good choice if you are looking for apples to cook with in early August. The key to its success in the kitchen is its tart acidic flavor which holds up well in cooking. Slices usually lose their shape during cooking, making Duchess of Oldenburg best suited for recipes that require apple sauce.

"Egremont Russet apple tree","Apple tree","
Egremont Russet is a classic English russet apple from the Victorian era. It remains popular with discerning apple lovers who appreciate its unique flavor and apearance.
Egremont Russet is a medium-sized apple. The flesh seems quite dry and gets drier with keeping - it is moist rather than juicy. Traditionally described as ""nutty"", the flavor is more delicate than most varieties, and quite sweet. Both the flavor and the soft flesh are reminiscent of a firm pear. Yet Egremont Russet is surprisingly versatile, working well in savoury salads for example, and a popular partner for cheese.
Like many russets, Egremont Russet is a good apple for sweet cider.  The apples are not particularly juicy, so you need plenty of them, but the resulting cider is rich, thick, and very sweet.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Egremont Russet apple tree is back in stock.
Egremont Russet is easy to grow, with generally good disease resistance, and a reliable though not heavy cropper.
It can be grown in most of the cooler zones of the USA. For an English apple variety it is unusually cold-hardy and on a suitable rootstock can be grown in zones 4 and perhaps zone 3.

"Elstar apple tree","Apple tree","
A particularly attractive late-season apple with a very good flavor, related to Golden Delicious and (more distantly) Cox's Orange Pippin.
The skin can have a marbled appearance, often with a soft sheen to it. It tends to lack the perfect smoothness of many modern varieties. The underlying color is golden yellow but overlaid with deep red. The flavor can be more intense than is often the case with other Golden Delicious offspring, but it retains the appealing sweetness - usually described as 'honeyed' in most apple text books. It also inherits the good keeping qualities of Golden Delicious. All in all this is a variety worthy of wider planting.

"Empire apple tree","Apple tree","
Empire was developed in the 1940s as a cross between McIntosh and Red Delicious and soon established itself as one of the top McIntosh-style apples.
As with most McIntosh crosses, the contribution of the other parent remains in the background, and Empire has all the usual McIntosh characteristics - crimson skin, bright white glistening flesh, and ""that"" flavor, the dessert-wine taste which is the hallmark of the McIntosh line. However Red Delicious can also be quite scented in its own right and many argue that Empire improves on the Mac in this respect.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Empire apple tree is back in stock.
As with many of the McIntosh offspring, Empire is a heavy producer and will readily set a large crop of small apples if you let it - thin the crop just after blossom is over to get fewer but larger apples and better flavor. Apart from that, there are few issues with Empire. Be on your guard for scab, to which it is susceptible, but it is generally problem-free.
Empire likes a climate with warm autumn sunshine and cool autumn nights, and may not achieve the right texture south of zone 7. Even so its range is better than McIntosh.

Fameuse is one of the oldest apples originating in Canada, with a history dating back to the early 18th century in Quebec, and probably much older.
It is also known as the Snow Apple, and as the name suggests, is a hardy variety, and very well-suited to the north country.
Fameuse has distinctive bright white soft flesh, with a sweet wine-like flavor. It is the probable parent of McIntosh, and the crimson skin, white flesh, and sweet flavor are characteristics of most of its descendants.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Fameuse apple tree is back in stock.
As its alternative name ""Snow apple"" suggests, Fameuse is a good choice for all northern states. It is usually cold hardy to zone 4. Perhaps surprisingly, it also performs fairly well in warmer climates, including southern California.
It is susceptible to scab but very resistant to most other apple diseases.
The main horticultural challenge is its tendency to lapse into biennial bearing - fruiting in alternate years. This can sometimes be prevented by heavy thinning of the fruitlets in the ""on"" year.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Fameuse is strongly associated with the French-speaking province of Quebec, and it is thought it was raised from seedlings brought over by early French settlers to Canada. It is known to have been planted in the USA by the 1730s.
Whilst it is an interesting variety in its own right, Fameuse is perhaps best known as the probable parent of the popular McIntosh apple variety. It is therefore at the head of one of the most important apple pedigrees, with dozens of descendants, many of them commercially important varieties.
Fameuse is widely known in English-speaking areas as the Snow Apple, reflecting its ability to thrive in northern climates.","Late","Eating fresh, Juice","Heavy","1-2 months","Vinous",,,"Ripens over a period",,,"Average","Not self-fertile",2,"Average","Diploid","Average vigour",,"Biennial tendency","Spur-bearer",,"Good","Very susceptible","Very resistant","Some resistance",,"Some resistance",,"(4) -30F / -34C","Cool ( 20-24C / 68-75F), Warm (25-30C / 76-85F)",,,"Canada","1650 - 1699","Crimson",,

Freyberg is a relatively unknown apple variety, yet it has an excellent pedigree - it is a cross between the English Cox's Orange Pippin and the American Golden Delicious, two outstanding but very different apples.
In most respects Freyberg is a Golden Delicious style apple - a green skin ripening to golden yellow, with lightly crisp cream flesh and an excellent sweet flavor. The flavor is however quite a lot more complex than a regular Golden Delicious, reflecting the aromatic influence of Cox's Orange Pippin.

Freyberg was raised in the 1930s by the famous New Zealand apple breeder J.H. Kidd, who also developed Kidd's Orange Red and Gala. Kidd did not live to see Freyberg (or Gala) but the seedling trees of many of his varieties were bequeathed to the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which developed them in trial orchards. Freyberg was named in 1959 after Lord Freyberg, the Governor-General of New Zealand from 1946-1952. It is sometimes incorrectly known as Freyburg.
It is interesting to compare Freyberg with Rubinette, which is also the result of crossing Cox's Orange Pippin and Golden Delicious.

"Fuji apple tree","Apple tree","
Malus domestica 'Fuji'
Although Fuji originates from Japan, its parentage is all-American, a cross between Red Delicious and Ralls Janet. In terms of shape and skin texture it looks like Ralls Janet - but with the strong red coloration of Red Delicious overlaid to produce a lovely pink hue - Fuji really is a very attractive apple. The colors can vary from red/pink flush over yellow to a deeper speckled pink.
The flavor is mild, and pleasantly sweet with very little tartness. Fuji has the potential to achieve high quality flavor and texture when grown in the right conditions. It also has remarkable keeping qualities, even in natural cold storage.
Fuji is unusual in that there are a number of different forms or ""sports"", many of them ripening much earlier than the original forms. Customers in the northern states may have more success with the early ripening Fuji variants: Rising Sun, September Wonder, Beni Shogun - these should all ripen in September. The later ripening forms include Sun Fuji, Myra, Nagano Red (as well as the original Fuji) - and typically ripen in late October.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Fuji apple tree is back in stock.
The key requirement to be aware of when considering growing Fuji is that it needs a warm climate and a very long growing season - picking of the original (late ripening) forms is likely to take place in October - November. Customers in the northern states may have more success with the September-ripening variants. If you live in the southern states or southern California, Fuji definitely deserves consideration.
Fuji seems to be a variety that repays care and attention by the grower during the growing season.

The popular crisp sweet Fuji apple is not easy to grow in cooler climates and areas with short summers, because it needs an exceptionally growing season. However there are a number of sports or variants of Fuji such as Beni Shogun, Rising Sun, and September Wonder, which keep the crisp sweetness of the original Fuji, but ripen up to 4 weeks earlier.
If you are in zones 5 or 6, or in an area such as the Pacific North West where the maritime climate moderates sunlight hours, early Fuji is more likely to succeed than the original late-season variety.

"Gala apple tree","Apple tree","
One of the most popular supermarket apple varieties, and a good mid-season variety for the garden in many areas. The sweet flavor of ripe Gala apples eaten straight from the tree is quite a surprise compared to supermarket examples. Gala is also a good variety for juicing, as you might expect the flavor is rich and sweet, useful for mixing with other sharper varieties.
Because of the commercial importance of Gala a large number of Gala ""sports"" exist. These are naturally occuring mutations, and are mostly indistinguishable from the original in terms of flavor but may have a deeper coloration or more pronounced flush to the skin.
IMPORTANT NOTE We strongly recommend Galarina or Sansa for backyard growers, in preference to Gala.  Both these varieties are closely related to Gala and have similar appearance and flavors, but both have better disease-resistance and are better suited to the home orchard.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Gala apple tree is back in stock.
Gala is grown on a commercial basis in South Africa, Chile, New Zealand, and France. One of its unique characteristics is that Gala will produce good-quality apples across an unusually wide range of climates from cool temperate to hot. Whilst not quite a low-chill variety, its chilling requirement of about 800 hours is at the lower end of the range, which helps when growing in warmer climate zones.
In the USA it can be grown with good quality from zones 5-9.
Gala appears to be susceptible to just about every problem known to affect apples, but don't let this put you off. In practice, provided you have a dry climate, it is not too difficult to grow - and the flavor of home-grown ripe Gala apples us worth a bit of effort.
Most sports of Gala have some degree of self-fertility - but will set much better crops if there is a nearby pollination partner.

"GoldRush apple tree","Apple tree","
GoldRush is a modern disease-resistant apple, equally suitable for commercial growers or gardeners and home orchardists. It is widely recognized as one of the best of all modern apples, both in terms of its flavor and its growth characteristics. It makes a fine addition to any backyard orchard.
Its parentage is complex, but it is derived from Golden Delicious and inherits that variety's excellent hard crispness, sweetness, and long storage capability.
The flavor when freshly-picked is pronounced and distinctly sharper than Golden Delicious, but it sweetens in storage and it has a good balance of sweet and sharp flavors. The trees are compact and neat.
Unusually for a modern variety, GoldRush has rapidly become popular for hard cider production - it is a juicy apple, and the juice is also very characterful, with an intense rich tangy sweetness which makes a great addition to cider blends. It is a good variety for sweet cider too.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when GoldRush apple tree is back in stock.
GoldRush has a tendency to over-crop which if not checked can lead to biennial bearing as the tree gets older. However this is easily remedied by thinning the crop in late spring.
It is very resistant to scab, and fairly resistant to fireblight. However it is susceptible to cedar apple rust in the south and southern mid-west, and may require a basic fungicide in these areas.
GoldRush blossoms quite late, and therefore needs another late-flowering variety nearby for pollination.
GoldRush also ripens quite late and benefits from a long growing season - harvesting in upstate New York would typically be in late October or even early November. Growers in the northern states should therefore make sure the tree is in a sheltered south-facing location in full sun. Training against a south-facing wall may als be beneficial.
Notwithstanding the above, GoldRush is generally a foolproof apple for most areas - from the north country to the southern states and southern California.

"Granny Smith apple tree","Apple tree","
The popular Australian Granny Smith apple grows happily in many parts of the United States. Like many of the well-known supermarket varieties, Granny Smith is undergoing something of a renaissance as apple enthusiasts discover that the qualities that have made it so successful as a supermarket apple can also be useful in the home orchard.
Granny Smith is a versatile apple, great for eating fresh of course, but also a good apple for sweet and savoury salads (since it does not go brown readily) and a good choice for apple pies - slices keep their shape when cooked. (For best cooking results, pick when slightly under-ripe).
Granny Smith prefers the warmer zones - 6 and higher - but can be grown across quite a wide range, and zone 5 is a possibility although be aware that it likes a long growing season to ripen. The flavor of home-grown examples in the warmer states can be more complex and interesting than the one-dimensional tart acidity of store-bought apples, particularly if you allow the apples to ripen fully on the tree.
As well as the distinctive green skin and tart flavor, Granny Smith is well known for its excellent keeping qualities. It is one of the best apples for home storage.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Granny Smith apple tree is back in stock.
Cropping is usually very good but the famous bright green color is only achieved in areas of warm days and nights. In cooler zones where temperatures drop overnight Granny Smith can develop an attractive but uncharacteristic red flush.
Granny Smith is generally easy to grow, but it can lapse into biennial bearing if allowed to over-crop.
One of the unusual features of Granny Smith is that the apples tend to grow within the foliage, on the inside rather than the outside of the tree - as can be seen in our main photo.
Granny Smith is a very good pollinator of other apple varieties, making it an excellent choice if you are establishing a small orchard in the warmer climate zones.

"Gravenstein apple tree","Apple tree","
Gravenstein is a high-quality dual-purpose apple variety, originally from Europe, but well-established in North America. It can be grown in most US climate zones.
Gravenstein has never achieved great commercial success, but ""Gravs"" remain extremely popular with apple enthusiasts around the world. The flavor, both for eating fresh and (especially) for cooking is unusually good for such an early-season variety.
Like most early-season apples Gravenstein does not keep that well but, usefully, the apples tend to ripen individually over the course of a couple of weeks so you are not necessarily faced with a sudden glut. (This lengthy ripening time is one of the reasons Gravenstein is not successful as a commercial variety, but is a plus for the home orchardist).
Gravensteins have a distinctive flushed coloring, which begins in mid-August as a few streaks of red, and spreads to cover the whole apple by the end of the picking season in mid-September.

Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Gravenstein apple tree is back in stock.
Gravenstein is sometimes regarded as an unreliable or difficult variety - but part of this is likely to be caused by poor pollination. There are two pollination-related issues to be aware of when growing Gravenstein. Firstly it is a triploid variety, so it will not pollinate other apple varieties. Secondly it flowers very early in the season, when not many other apple varieties are in flower to pollinate it. Therefore most of the reliability problems with Gravenstein can be resolved by making sure you have some other early-flowering apple trees (of different varieties) nearby. See our pollination checker for suggestions. Whilst we put Gravenstein in flowering group 1 to help ensure that other early-blooming varieties are listed against it in our pollination checker, it is worth noting that Gravenstein can flower over a long period and sometimes appears to have a second flush of blossoms later in the flowering season. Therefore perhaps the best advice is to plant a couple of good early/mid-season pollinators nearby - a crab-apple would be ideal.
Reflecting its triploid nature, Gravenstein trees tend to be quite large and long-lived.
Gravenstein can be susceptible to various apple diseases, although there is no obvious pattern and it does seem to be down to local conditions and climate. It appears to prefer cooler climates, and although it has a reputation for being a bit temperaramental, is surprisingly cold hardy. It can be very susceptible to fireblight in those areas where it is prevalent.
In short Gravenstein is not the easiest apple to grow, but a lot of apple enthusiasts are prepared to keep trying because the flavor is so good! It is therefore not the best choice if it is to be your only source of garden apples, but if you already have other apple trees then Gravenstein is well worth taking a chance on.

"Grimes Golden apple tree","Apple tree","
Grimes Golden is of historical interest as the probable parent of Golden Delicious, and is usually considered to have a richer flavor than its offspring. Spicy sweetness is perhaps the best way to describe it.
It is green/yellow in color, changing to yellow in storage.  The apples store well and have a high sugar content.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Grimes Golden apple tree is back in stock.
Grimes Golden has a narrower climate range than Golden Delicious, being traditionally an apple for the central and eastern states, zones 5 and 6, and not especially winter hardy. Grimes Golden is generally productive but not necessarily a regular bearer, which was one of the main reasons it was replaced by Golden Delicious as a commercial apple - however the home grower is likely to put up with Grimes Golden's uncertain productivity as a trade-off for its richer flavor.
In a good spring the fruitlets may require thinning. Fruit size is generally larger in the higher zones.
It is self-fertile and (like Golden Delicious) a good pollinator for other apple varieties.

Holstein is an attractive high quality apple for eating fresh. It has a very good aromatic flavor.
Holstein is thought to be a Cox seedling, but many of its characteristics seem to hark back to Ribston Pippin (the probable parent of Cox). Like Ribston Pippin it is quite a large apple, with coarser flesh and a more robust flavor than Cox.
This is a good variety for pressing, the juice has a complex balanced flavor and is an attractive light orange color.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Holstein apple tree is back in stock.
Like Cox, Holstein is somewhat disease prone, but its natural triploid vigor means that it usually crops heavily anyway.

"Honeycrisp apple tree","Apple tree","
Honeycrisp is a very attractive high quality apple with a predominantly sweet flavor. It lives up to its name - it is a remarkably crisp apple and one of the outstanding new apples of the late 20th century. The flavor is excellent, with a rich sweetness and good balancing acidity.
The apples are medium-to-large in size, with a light green/yellow background largely covered with red-orange flush occasionally with a hint of pink. They keep well in storage, and retain their unique crispness.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Honeycrisp apple tree is back in stock.
Honeycrisp was developed to be cold-hardy and is a good variety for colder apple-growing regions, where its crispness and sweetness are enhanced - although it likes a warm fall season. It is one of the most cold-hardy of all apple varieties.
However don't think this means it won't grow in the southern states - Honeycrisp has a wide climate range and seems quite at home in warmer zones. Although we normally suggest up to Zone 8, it can be grown in even warmer zones such as southern California.
The well-balanced flavor can become bland if the tree is allowed to over-crop - and Honeycrisp does tend to over-crop if given a chance. This can also lead to pre-harvest drop, a particular issue with Honeycrisp in warmer areas. So whilst this is not a tree that requires thinning if outright production is your goal, if you want the best flavor then thin the fruitlets as soon as they have formed.
Honeycrisp is known for its excellent scab-resistance. It appears to have some resistance to fireblight as well, but if you are in a fireblight area the University of Minnesotal recommends using fireblight-resistant rootstocks, such as the Geneva series.
It is a good idea to let Honeycrisp trees reach their full size before allowing cropping to begin, so remove any fruitlets that might form in the early years.

"Isaac Newton's Tree apple tree","Apple tree","
Every school student knows Sir Isaac Newton had the inspiration for his theory of gravity when sitting under an apple tree and pondering why apples fall. This lovely story, which was related by Newton himself to several correspondents, occurred in the summer of 1666 - about 350 years ago.
What is perhaps less well-known is that the variety of apple which the famous scientist saw falling from the tree has been positively identified. The incident is known to have taken place in his garden at Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire, England - and fortunately there was only one apple tree in the garden. It was subsequently identified as a very old English variety (not surprisingly) called Flower of Kent.
Even more remarkably, this apple tree, which must surely be the most important in the history of science, is still alive. The tree appears to have blown over several times in its life, but each time has re-grown from the roots.
As might be expected of a variety from this period, Flower of Kent is a large sharp-tasting cooking apple with juicy crisp flesh.
Many cuttings have since been taken from the famous scientist's tree, and it is a popular variety in the grounds of university physics departments around the world.
The trees we supply are propagated from a nursery tree which was raised from a cutting of a Flower of Kent apple tree originally obtained by the USDA Geneva research station. It is likely this tree was in turn propagated from cuttings sent from the RHS at Wisley in England.

Malus domestica 'Jonagold'
Jonagold is a widely-grown American apple variety with an excellent rich aromatic flavor. It is widely grown in the USA and Europe.
Jonagold stores well, a quality it inherits from one of its parents, Golden Delicious. However it gets its excellent flavor from its other parent, the well-respected old New York apple variety Jonathan. It has a combination of good sweetness and good sharpness that often denotes a high quality apple.
Jonagold is a very versatile apple. As well as being excellent for eating fresh, it is a popular for all kinds of culinary uses, and good for juice and cider. The apples can be picked over several weeks - pick earlier if you want to store them.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Jonagold apple tree is back in stock.
The main horticultural issue is that Jonagold is a triploid apple variety and therefore needs two separate pollination partners nearby (or one self-fertile one). If you have apple trees nearby or in neighboring gardens, they may be suitable. Golden Delicious is a reliable pollinator of many varieties but Jonagold is an exception and cannot be pollinated by Golden Delicious. Like most triploid apple varieties, Jonagold produces a fairly large tree and the apples are also fairly large. Cropping is generally good and there is no need to thin the fruit.
Jonagold is susceptible to a number of apple diseases, but its vigorous triploid nature seems to help it keep going.
Jonagold likes a warmer climate but can be grown across quite a wide climate range.

However as with many old varieties there are many stories surrounding its origins. Visually and in terms of the quality of flavor, the relation with Spitzenburg seems likely.

Keepsake is a late-ripening winter apple with a good strong apple flavor - at its best in mid-winter. The apples have a full rich flavor, and a juicy crisp texture.
Keepsake was released in the 1980s but did not achieve much commercial success, perhaps because the apples can be a bit uneven in shape. However the combination of good flavor and disease-resistance makes it a useful choice for the backyard orchard, particularly in the northern states.

"Kidd's Orange Red apple tree","Apple tree","
Kidd's Orange Red is one of the select band of apple varieties which can truly be said to rival the definitive Cox's Orange Pippin for flavor. It is primarily a sweet apple, but unlike most sweet apples it has a rich complexity to the flavors too. Kidd's Orange Red is fairly crisp but also pleasantly chewy, and each bite seems to release yet more juice and flavor. It's in some ways reminiscent of a good French dessert wine - sweet, but with a good kick to it.
Although regarded as a typical 'English' apple, Kidd's Orange Red was developed by New Zealand apple enthusiast J.H. Kidd in the 1920s and is a cross between the English Cox and the American Delicious, so in reality it is a marriage of the Old World and the New World. There is no doubting this is a Cox-style apple though ... but when you know the parentage, it isn't hard to spot the sweet scented contribution from Delicious in the background, and it is a combination that really works.
The tree grows attractively, and the crimson pink blossom is a particular feature.
Although primarily an apple for eating fresh, Kidd's Orange Red also produces a high quality sweet cider, with a pleasing thick texture.

Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Kidd's Orange Red apple tree is back in stock.
It often seems that apples with the best flavor are the most difficult to grow, but this is not the case with Kidd's Orange Red. It is very easy to grow, generally problem-free (like many varieties descended from Delicious), and makes an excellent garden variety for most regions, including cool temperate climates and warmer climates.
It forms an attractive-looking tree with long branches which grow vertically when the tree is young but then bend over with fruit as the tree comes into bearing. If necessary, tie the young branches towards the horizontal to improve the appearance - this will also help cropping. Certainly worth considering as a feature apple tree.
Kidd's Orange Red is a good choice if you are not keen on pruning, as its branches and fruiting spurs do not become congested as the tree ages.
The only caveats are that it is not a heavy-cropper (although it does produce a good crop). Fruit size can be on the small size so moderate thinning can be helpful as the fruitlets start to form.
Kidd's Orange Red has a much wider climate range than Cox's Orange Pippin and can tolerate hotter summers without losing flavor, making it one one of the best alternatives in the USA for enthusiasts who find their climate is too hot for Cox.

"Lady (Api) apple tree","Apple tree","
Lady Apple, or Api, is a small apple with a strong pleasant aroma and rich aromatic flavor.
Throughout its history Lady Apple has been associated as much with decoration and adornment as with the normal eating and cooking uses of apples. There are records of it being used to freshen or mask unpleasant odours, and even as a pattern for refined ladies to powder their noses. Victorian author Robert Hogg quotes a contemporary calling it ""Une pomme des damoiselles et de bonne compagnie"" - an apple for ladies and good company.
The tree is a heavy cropper and branches laden with apples can be used as wreaths.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Lady (Api) apple tree is back in stock.
Lady Apple is a small tree, but it bears heavily. The combination of weak vigor and heavy-cropping is a recipe for biennial bearing - fruiting only in alternate years. If you notice this tendency developing try to thin the fruitlets heavily in the ""on"" year to reduce the crop, which will prevent the tree exhausting itself and ensure a crop the following year.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Although often known as Lady Apple in North America, this variety originated in France, where it is called Api, and where several related varieties are also known.
It is clear that Api is a very old apple. Some authorities have speculated that Api is a variety known in Roman times as Appius or Appia. However both the Victorian pomologist Robert Hogg and Joan Morgan in her New Book of Apples question this.
More certain records suggest that Api is a seedling variety originating from the Forest of Api in Bretagne in western France some time before the early 17th century. It soon became popular in France, England, and the United States - and according to Hogg large quantities were imported from the United States back to England in Victorian times under the name Lady Apple.

"Liberty apple tree","Apple tree","
Liberty is a modern apple variety, developed for disease resistance - it has very good resistance to scab, fireblight and cedar apple rust.
Liberty's disease resistance comes partly from a crab apple variety called Malus floribunda which is one of its distant ancestors, but it gets its clean well-balanced flavor from its immediate parent Macoun and grand-parent McIntosh. It also has the bright white flesh and sweet ""vinous"" flavor which is a characteristic of almost all apples which are descended from McIntosh, but with perhaps a bit more tartness. Overall the flavor can be considered first class with no compromise for being disease resistant.
Although primarily an apple for eating fresh, it can also be used for applesauce - which will be pink if you leave some of the skin on.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Liberty apple tree is back in stock.
The natural disease resistance make Liberty an excellent garden apple, particularly for fans of McIntosh-style apples. It is one of the best choices if you live in an area where cedar-apple rust (CAR) is prevalent, as it is very resistant to this disease - although note that ""disease-resistant"" does not mean ""disease-proof"".
Liberty trees are fairly vigorous and precocious. The fruitlets will require thinning in most seasons, to avoid a very large crop of very small apples. The apples ripen over a period so you do not have to pick them all at once.
Liberty will grow in most climates - it is probably better in cooler regions, but performs well in warmer climates including southern California . It is generally a fool-proof and reliable apple.
There is some evidence that Liberty is a triploid variety - with 3 sets of chromosomes instead of the more usual 2 sets (diploid). Triploid varieties often have good disease resistance, but Liberty does not have some of the other physical characteristics associated with triploid varieties, such as very large size and vigour. There is also some evidence that Liberty might have a degree of self-fertility, and again this is sometimes seen in other triploid varieties. Overall we think it is best to assume Liberty will not pollinate other apple varieties and is not self-fertile, but other compatible apple and crab-apple varieties will readily pollinate Liberty.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Liberty was developed at the Geneva Experimental Station, New York and introduced in 1978. It is related to Macoun.
During the research program which led to this variety, seedling trees were exposed to scab spores, cedar apple rust spores, and fireblight.","Late","Eating fresh, Juice","Heavy","1-2 months","Vinous",,,"Normal ripening",,,"Beginner","Not self-fertile",2,"Poor","Triploid","Vigorous",,"Regular","Spur-bearer","Suitable","Good","Very resistant","Some resistance","Some resistance","Very resistant",,,"(4) -30F / -34C","Cool ( 20-24C / 68-75F), Warm (25-30C / 76-85F), Hot (>30C / 86F)",,,"United States","1950 - 1999","Crimson",,
"Macoun apple tree","Apple tree","
Macoun is a McIntosh-style apple, widely grown in New England and with arguably the best flavor of its siblings. It is a sweet refreshing apple with a pronounced flower-like vinous flavor.  The flesh has a soft crisp texture and plenty of juice.
Although it ripens late, Macoun is not a keeper - this is an apple that is definitely at its best when picked and eaten straight from the tree.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Macoun apple tree is back in stock.
Macoun inherits most of the characteristics of the McIntosh family. It is happiest in the cooler zones of the north-east, and benefits from cool autumn nights to bring out the color and flavor.
As with most McIntosh offspring, Macoun is prone to over-cropping. To improve fruit size and quality it is usually necessary to thin the fruitlets in early June - one visitor to our website suggested thinning should be ""merciless"". This will also help to prevent the biennial bearing to which Macoun can be prone.
Macoun produces a vigorous tree that is fairly easy to grow. It is somewhat susceptible to scab but resistant to cedar apple rust and fireblight.

Newtown Pippin is an antique American apple variety with a history going back more than 250 years. It is not the prettiest apple you ever saw, but it is one of the best-flavored - aromatic with plenty of acid and pleasantly refreshing, and sometimes a pineapple-like note. The flesh is dense, crisp and juicy.
Newtown Pippin is not an apple to eat straight from the tree, instead it should be harvested in mid-October and then stored in a cold dark frost-free shed for a month or so, which gives the rich sweet flavor time to develop. It is a versatile apple for use in the winter, for eating fresh, cookery and also for juicing.
The rich aromatic flavor of Newtown Pippin was held in high regard in Victorian England too. The well-known Victorian pomologist Hogg referrred to it as ""A dessert apple, which, when in perfection, is not to be surpassed"". Hogg also records that the Newtown Pippins tended to arrive in London markets in January, after the sea-voyage from the USA - at which point they will have been at the peak of flavor.

Newtown Pippin is a fairly reliable tree. Although susceptible to scab and most of the other diseases of apples, its natural vigour helps it to keep going.
It is a heavy-cropping variety and can lapse into biennial bearing - this can be prevented by thinning the crop in late spring (particularly in the ""on"" year).
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Newtown Pippin originates from Newtown, Long Island. It is one of the earliest apple varieties raised in North America, well-known in the 18th century, and a commercially-grown variety during the 19th century. It was introduced to England in the 1750s.
Historically two variants of Newtown Pippin have been recognized, a Green and a Yellow - the latter sometimes known as Albermarle Pippin, the former occasionally known as Green Newtown or Brooke Pippin. In practice they are both primarily green apples and almost impossible to distinguish. It is now thought there is probably no genetic difference between them, rather that Newtown Pippin is essentially a green apple, but with a tendency to develop a yellow flush in some local climates.","Late","Eating fresh, Culinary, Juice, Hard cider, Traditional cooker","Heavy","3 months or more","Aromatic",,,"Normal ripening","Some susceptibility","Textured puree","Average","Not self-fertile",3,"Average","Diploid","Vigorous","Slow to start bearing","Biennial tendency","Partial tip-bearer",,"Average","Some susceptibility","Some susceptibility","Some susceptibility",,"Some susceptibility",,"(4) -30F / -34C","Cool ( 20-24C / 68-75F), Warm (25-30C / 76-85F)","Low-chill",,"United States","1750 - 1799",,,"Slow Food - Ark of Taste"

Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Northern Spy apple tree is back in stock.
Northern Spy has a reputation as a tough hardy heavy-cropping apple variety. However it is quite susceptible to many of the usual range of apple diseases, particularly mildew and fireblight. Northern Spy also takes its time to come into bearing, and when it does, it can over-crop and then fall into a biennial bearing habit. This can be avoided by preventing over-cropping in the ""on"" year. Don't let these issues put you off though, as Northern Spy's natural vigour helps it to grow through many of these difficulties, and on a dwarfing rootstock it should start bearing within 4 years.
One of the reasons that Northern Spy is so successful in colder zones is that it blossoms quite late. It helps if you have other late-flowering varieties nearby such as Ashmead's Kernel or Spitzenberg.

"Pixie CrunchTM apple tree","Apple tree","
Pixie Crunchâ¢ is a modern disease-resistant apple with a really excellent flavor and, as the name suggests, a crunchy crisp texture. Whilst the texture is great, it is the sweet flavor with a slight hint of tartness which leaps out at you and marks this variety out from the rest. There is no doubt this is a very desirable apple.
The name Pixie Crunch was chosen to reflect the relatively small size and crisp flesh of this apple. It is smaller than modern rivals such as Honeycrisp, but ideal to eat as a snack on the go.
Pixie Crunch makes a great choice for the home grower as the apples stay fresh on the tree for several weeks.
Please note that Pixie Crunch is a trademarked and patented variety, and purchasers agree not to propagate or distribute the trees. In addition, customer address details may be made available to the licence holder if requested.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Pixie Crunch apple tree is back in stock.
Pixie Crunch has excellent scab resistance. However it is best avoided in areas prone to cedar apple rust or fireblight as it is slightly susceptible, although fireblight resistance is improved if using a resistant rootstock (e.g. the Geneva or G-series rootstocks).
Pixie Crunch also seems to tolerate warm humid climates fairly well.
Try not to allow the tree to over-crop as it has a slight tendency to become a biennial bearer.
Harvesting can take place over a period of 2-3 weeks - useful if you like to eat apples fresh from the tree.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Pixie Crunch was developed in a breeding program involving Purdue, Rutgers and Illinois universities, beginning in 1971. It was known as ""Co-op 33"" during this period, and subsequently released under the trademarked name Pixie Crunch.
As with most modern apples, the pedigree is complex but several of the crosses involve Rome Beauty, a variety well-known for its good productivity, pleasing clean appearance, and generally sound disease resistance. Pixie Crunch seems to inherit these attractive qualities, but its crisp sweet flavor probably come from one of its other ancestors, Golden Delicious. It has to be said that Pixie Crunch is far more than the sum of its parts, its texture and flavor make this is one of the best modern apples.","Mid","Eating fresh","Good","1-2 months","Sweet/Sharp",,,"Ripens over a period",,,"Beginner","Not self-fertile",4,"Average","Diploid","Average vigour",,"Biennial tendency","Spur-bearer","Suitable","Good","Very resistant","Some susceptibility","Some susceptibility","Very susceptible",,,,"Cool ( 20-24C / 68-75F), Warm (25-30C / 76-85F)",,,"United States","1950 - 1999","Red",,

"Cox Queen apple tree","Apple tree","
Queen Cox is a variant of the original Cox's Orange Pippin, and is perhaps the best of all the many forms of Cox's Orange Pippin.
The most noticeable difference is a slightly deeper skin colouring, but the fruit-size can also be slightly larger and the texture may be slightly crisper ... although these are nuances and may vary from year to year.
In any case there is no doubt that Queen Cox has all the aromatic qualities associated with Cox's Orange Pippin, and in flavor terms is by any standards a remarkably good apple.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Cox Queen apple tree is back in stock.
Queen Cox is a reliably self-fertile form of Cox's Orange Pippin.
Queen Cox is a poor pollinator of other apple varieties, partly because many are related to Cox, and partly because its self-fertility seems to reduce the viability of the pollen for cross-pollination.
In other respects growing Queen Cox means dealing with the same challenges as the original. Disease-resistance is only average, and it does best in areas with cool summer temperatures.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Queen Cox was raised from a self-fertile form of the original Cox's Orange Pippin at the Long Ashton research station near Bristol, England in the 1970s. It is possible the scion material for this development was propagated from a naturally-occurring bud-sport of Cox's Orange Pippin found in an orchard in the county of Berkshire in the 1950s, although the Berkshire form is not self-fertile.

Along with Roxbury Russet, Rhode Island Greening is generally considered the oldest apple variety in North America, with records going back to the 17th century. Whereas Roxbury Russet has only recently come back into favor, Rhode Island Greening has always been a popular variety with many commercial plantings - largely because apple pie made with these apples is very hard to beat.

Roxbury Russet is an apple variety that traces its history right back to the colonial era, and it is thought to be the oldest apple variety originating in North America - almost certainly a seedling of a European variety brought over by the early colonists. It remains popular as a variety for gardens and small orchards, not just for its history but because it is also a good all-round apple.
Roxbury Russet is a typical russet apple, with a sweet flavor. However it is larger than most russet apples. The extent of russeting can vary from considerable to minimal, and like many russets it can develop an attractive sun-kissed flush as well.
It has many uses from eating fresh to sweet and savoury salads, juicing and cider. It keeps well in cold storage and can be used throughout the winter months.

Like many antique apples, Roxbury Russet has some natural resistance to some of the diseases prevalent in the areas it originated, notably cedar apple rust, fireblight and scab.
Part of the reason for its success is that Roxbury Russet is both a very reliable and a very good keeper - qualities which are as useful today as when it was first discovered.
Although usually associated with the eastern apple-growing areas, Roxbury Russet has a good climate range - including coastal southern California.

"Rubinette apple tree","Apple tree","
If you want to grow the best-tasting apple in the world, this is probably it. This unassuming apple has perhaps the most remarkable flavor of any variety. The balance between sweetness and sharpness is often a good indicator of flavor quality in apples - and in Rubinette that balance is close to perfection.
Most people who try Rubinette agree it is the best apple they have ever eaten - here is a selection of the tasting notes from our sister website about Rubinette:
""Undoubtedly the best tasting variety we grow …""
""Rubinettes are, by far, the tastiest apples I have ever eaten.""
""... the most delicious apple I have had in years.""
"" ... a wonderful little apple.""
""Crisp-juicy-flavorsome-tart - the most tasty apple we have had for years.""

""Extreme summer heat did not bother it and the flavor and crunch were outstanding.""
""... the best apples I have eaten.""
""... spent a couple of hours tasting a huge variety of apples, and we all kept coming back to Rubinette.""
""This apple is a revelation ...""
Although it is a cross between Cox's Orange Pippin and Golden Delicious, the depth and subtlety of Rubinette's flavor comes almost entirely from Cox's Orange Pippin.

Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Rubinette apple tree is back in stock.
The main issue with Rubinette is its tendency to produce a large quantity of small apples. This is easily addressed by thinning the fruitlets in late spring just after the blossom finishes - allow no more than 1 fruit per set of blossoms. An unusual feature of Rubinette is that fruit size usually improves as the tree gets older, with good size being achieved about 3 years after planting.
Rubinette can be grown with some success without any chemical treatments (we do ourselves) but spraying against scab (using either conventional or organic pesticides) should give better results in wetter climates. Keep the ground around the tree free from grass and use a mulch to suppress weeds. Religiously clear up all old fruit and fruitlets to deny pests and diseases a home over winter.
Rubinette is a good choice for apple enthusiasts in warmer areas of North America who have not been able to achieve satisfactory results growing Cox's Orange Pippin. Rubinette performs much better than Cox in warmer climates, including southern California. However it is equally at home in cooler temperate climates and can be grown anywhere that Cox can be grown.
Most growers also find that Rubinette maintains a consistently high quality flavor every year, regardless of the weather.

Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Rubinette was developed in the mid-20th century by Walter Hauenstein, a grower from Rafz in Switzerland (hence it is sometimes known as Rafzubin). It is a marriage of two of the world's greatest apple varieties - Cox's Orange Pippin and Golden Delicious.
Hauenstein was originally hoping to produce an ""improved"" Golden Delicious, but as it turned out Rubinette inherited almost all its characteristics from Cox's Orange Pippin. It is an essential variety for Cox enthusiasts.

Saint Edmund's Russet is a good backyard apple variety, it crops reliably and grows in a wide range of conditions. Like many russet varieties, it has some natural resistance to many of the main apple diseases, including cedar apple rust.
The only thing to look out for is that it can be a partial tip-bearer - some apples are borne on the ends of shoots rather than the more usual short fruit-bearing spurs. For this reason it is best to keep pruning to a minimum, to avoid accidentally pruning the fruit-bearing tips of shoots.

"Spartan apple tree","Apple tree","
Spartan is a deep marroon-colored apple with an excellent refreshing sweet flavor. Apple text books often describe the flavor as ""vinous"" and it can indeed have a wine-like quality, although this is first and foremost a crisp sweet juicy unpretentious apple.
That flavor, and the crimson skin, are an easy clue that Spartan is related to the famous Canadian McIntosh apple. Spartan is undoubtedly one of the best of the many varieties which trace their ancestry back to McIntosh.
Spartan ripens quite late in the season, usually around early October. The apples will remain on the tree over a 2-3 week period, which means you can pick a few at a time rather than have to deal with a glut. This is also the best way to enjoy them because although they keep fairly well, the flavor and crispness fade in storage.
Spartan is a simple unpretentious apple, and when eaten straight from the tree on a crisp cold morning is a real delight.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Spartan apple tree is back in stock.
Spartan is very easy to grow in almost any climate. Although the natural home of most McIntosh-style apples is the north-east of North America, Spartan seems happy in most situations. As might be expected from a Canadian variety, it is naturally cold-hardy.
It crops reliably and heavily. The fruit tends to be small but moderate thinning is very effective and the remaining apples will be a good medium/large size.
There are few disease problems, and birds and aphids are not often a problem either.
Spartan also tends to produce a reasonably neat and attractive tree.
Finally, the large quantity of blossom makes it a good pollinator for other apple varieties. The pollen is also viable at lower temperatures (50F rather than the usual 60F-70F required by other varieties) making it a useful variety to include if your orchard is in an area with cold spring weather.
All in all, you won't regret giving it space in your apple tree collection.

Spartan is one of the most widely-grown of the McIntosh family of apples, which are characterised by their deep maroon skinand bright white flesh. Spartan was developed at the Canadian Apple Research Station in Summerland, British Columbia, in the 1920s.

As the name suggests, Spigold is related to Northern Spy and Golden Delicious, and it seems to combine the best characteristics of both varieties. It is a large orange/red flushed apple, with a crisp flesh.
The excellent flavor and texture clearly come from Golden Delicious, but there are extra dimensions coming from the Northern Spy side, which make the flavor far more interesting than Golden Delicious.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Spigold apple tree is back in stock.
Spigold is a triploid variety, so will not pollinate other apples. However its triploid nature helps make it reasonably disease-resistant.
Whilst it is much easier to grow than Northern Spy, not all that variety's unruly growth habits have been eliminated. The main issue is that Spigold has a strong upright habit, which is not ideal for fruitful growth or limb strength, so try to encourage the new shoots to spread sideways rather than upwards whilst they are still young and pliable.
Spigold retains the Northern Spy tendency towards biennial bearing, so if the tree sets a heavy crop, be sure to thin the fruitlets in June - this will improve the flavor of the remaining apples and help prevent the tree becoming biennial.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Spigold was developed by the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station and released in 1962. It is a cross between Golden Delicious and Red Spy, a red-colored sport of Northern Spy.

The noted English author Hogg writing at the end of the 19th century also liked it, calling it ""a most excellent dessert apple"".
This is not a variety to eat straight from the tree - it needs to be stored for at least a month in a cold store (or fridge) for the flavor to mature - and it will keep until well into the new year. The flesh is dense and buttery with a rich sharp yet sweet quality, great for eating fresh on a winter's day - but also useful in the kitchen and good for juicing.

It is almost a truism with apples that the varieties with the best flavor are the hardest to grow. The main challenge with Esopus Spitzenberg is that it has poor disease resistance, although its natural vigour and productiveness helps it to keep going.
The flavor is at its best in cooler climates, and like many heirloom varieties Spitzenburg likes warm autumn days and cool autumn nights. However it has a wide climate range and should be successful in the southern states and southern California.

SunCrisp has a slight tendency to lapse into biennial bearing as it gets older. This can be prevented by actively thinning the fruitlets in June.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
SunCrisp was developed during the 1960s by Rutgers University, New Jersey, under the designation NJ55. It was released in 1994.
Suncrisp is a cross between Golden Delicious x (Cox's Orange Pippin x Cortland). It thus unites three major apple families - Golden Delicious, Cox, and McIntosh (parent of Cortland). Although disease-resistance was often the key goal of apple breeding programs in the latter half of the 20th century, the goal with SunCrisp seems to have been to achieve the best flavor.","Late","Eating fresh, Juice","Good","3 months or more","Sweeter",,,,,,"Average","Not self-fertile",3,"Average","Diploid","Average vigour","Precocious","Biennial tendency","Spur-bearer",,"Average","Some resistance",,"Some susceptibility",,,,,"Cool ( 20-24C / 68-75F), Warm (25-30C / 76-85F)",,,"United States","1950 - 1999","Yellow / Orange","Average",

Williams' Pride blooms slightly ahead of the main apple blossom season, but flowers over a long period, and is a good pollinator of many other apple varieties.
The tree is a strong grower, eventually producing a spreading shape.
Unlike many early varieties, which tend to drop their apples, Williams' Pride apples stay on the tree, and can be picked over an extended period of a week or so.
Williams' Pride has a wide climate range and is suitable for both cold and hot apple growing areas.

Williams' Pride was developed by the well-respected ""co-op"" breeding program of Purdue, Rutgers, and Illinois (PRI) universities in the 1970s, and originally known as Co-op 23. It's ancestry is similar to that of many of the PRI varieties, including Rome Beauty and Malus floribunda, but it's early-season character probably comes from Mollie's Delicious and Julyred.
It is named after Professor Edwin Williams of Purdue University, who led the disease-resistant apple research program at Purdue University.

"Winesap apple tree","Apple tree","
Probably the most well-known and well-regarded of all antique southern apples, Winesap is a useful addition to the home orchard because of its reliable cropping and good keeping properties.
Winesap is a notably crisp dense apple, and gets its name from the wine-like flavor when eaten fresh.
However first and foremost this is an apple variety for the kitchen, where its strong tart spicy flavor makes it a good base for traditional apple pies. Winesap can be used in recipes which require apples which keep their shape when cooked, but it breaks down quite easily and also works in recipes where a softer texture is required. Winesap is also a very good choice for juicing.
We sometimes have the Stayman Winesap as well, strictly speaking it is a different variety (it is thought to be a seedling of Winesap).
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Winesap apple tree is back in stock.
Winesap is easy to grow and has a reputation for being productive even on poor soils or bad years. Harvest is late September in the southern states.
The main thing to be aware of when growing Winesap is that it is a poor pollinator of other varieties. Paradoxically, its red-colored blossom is very attractive.  Note that the Stayman form is triploid and will not pollinate other varieties (and needs two other apple trees of different varieties nearby for its own pollination).
Like most heavy-cropping apple varieties, fruit-size can be improved by thinning the fruitlets in June.
Disease resistance is good, particularly against cedar apple rust (CAR) and fireblight.
Winesap is a southern apple but grows well in the northern states too.

"Yellow Transparent apple tree","Apple tree","
Yellow Transparent is an old Russian apple variety, quite widely grown in the northern states, and also in Europe (where, confusingly, it is known as White Transparent).
Yellow Transparent has two notable qualities. It ripens very early - often as early as the third week of July even in the northern states. Secondly, it is exceptionally cold-hardy, and capable of surviving winters in zone 3. It is therefore easy to see why Yellow Transparent became a popular variety in North America as the settlers moved west.
Yellow Transparent can be eaten fresh when fully ripe, but is primarily an apple for the kitchen, where it easily cooks down to a light apple sauce with a good flavor. For cooking it is best to pick the apples slightly green.
Perrine Yellow Transparent is a sport (natural bud mutation) of the original form, and is unusual for being a ""tetraploid"" variety - it has double the number of chromosomes of the original (""diploid"") form. The extra chromosomes are thought to be responsible for its better fruit size and the slightly larger and more vigorous tree size.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Yellow Transparent apple tree is back in stock.
Yellow Transparent has exceptional cold-hardiness, and has long been popular in the northern states for this reason.
In these areas it is also considered a good disease-resistant tree. However it is very susceptible to fireblight, so is not a good choice for areas where this disease is prevalent. It is probably also a good idea to choose fireblight-resistant rootstocks where possible. This aside, its natural vigour seems to help it shrug off most other problems.
The other horticultural issue is that Yellow Transparent can lapse into biennial bearing - fruiting only every other year. This seems to be associated with its natural tendency to over-crop, and this is definitely a variety that repays thinning of the fruitlets as they start to swell after the blossom.
The Perrine Yellow Transparent is generally considered to be slightly more disease-resistant than the original form.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Yellow Transparent originates from Russia and is probably a very old variety. It was widely grown throughout Europe in the 19th century, and also became popular in North America.
In Europe it is most commonly known as White Transparent, and confusingly, another variety - Transparente de Croncels - is more commonly known as Yellow Transparent.
Perrine Yellow Transparent was found by D.B. Perrine in an orchard in Centralia, Illinois, in the 1930s.

"Bramley's Seedling apple tree","Apple Cider tree","Bramley's Seedling is an outstanding English ""cooker"", and an essential variety for anyone interested in cooking with apples.
The reason for its versatility in the kitchen is its very high acid content, which is far higher than most traditional American cooking apples. As a result it readily cooks down to a stiff but light apple puree, which is regarded as a key requirement in English apple cookery. When cooked it has an excellent tangy sharp flavor which few other apples can match.
The copious juice also makes Bramley's Seedling valuable for juicing.  In English cider production it is used as a ""sharp"", to increase the acidity of cider blends.
Bramley's Seedling trees are well-known for being long-lived. The first tree was grown from a pip in a garden in Nottinghamshire, England, in 1809 - and amazingly this tree still survives.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Bramley's Seedling apple tree is back in stock.
Bramley's Seedling is a very vigorous triploid variety - it has three sets of chromosomes rather than the more usual two. Its triploid nature can be seen in the strong dark-coloured leaves, thick branches, and large apples. Bramley's Seedling is quite easy to grow, its great vigour and natural disease resistance means it usually throws off problems fairly easily.
As a triploid variety, Bramley's Seedling is not able to pollinate other apple varieties, but ironically it has attractive and prolific pink-flushed blossom. The fruit ripens late in the season, and stores very well.
Bramley's Seedling is one of the best English apples for growing in North America. Although it thrives in the cool temperate climate of an English summer, it is just as happy in hotter continental climates.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Bramley's Seedling was was raised from a pip by a young girl, Mary Ann Brailsford, near Nottingham, England, in 1809. The house, with the mature tree in the garden, was later sold to a Matthew Bramley who allowed cuttings to be propagated as long as his name was used. The original tree still survives - and can be seen in a video made by the BBC in 2011 (note the typical English summer weather!).
The new variety was quickly recognised as an outstanding cooking apple and by the end of the Victorian era it was widely planted in England and Northern Ireland, becoming synonymous with English apple cookery. However for the next century it remained little-known outside the UK, since European and North American growers had long preferred dual-purpose apples which could be both eaten fresh and cooked. Latterly with a resurgence in interest in apple cookery it has become well-known amongst North American apple enthusiasts and, 200 years after its birth, this remarkable ""cooker"" is increasingly recognized as one of the world's great apples varieties.","Late","Culinary, Juice, Hard cider, Traditional cooker","Heavy","3 months or more",,"Sharper","Pale yellow","Normal ripening","Some susceptibility","Puree","Average","Not self-fertile",3,"Poor","Triploid","Slightly large, Very vigorous","Precocious","Regular","Partial tip-bearer",,,"Very resistant","Some resistance","Some resistance","Some resistance",,,"(4) -30F / -34C, (5) -20F / -29C, (6) -10F / -23C, (7) 0F / -18C, (8) 10F / -12C, (9) 20F / -7C, (10) 30F / -1C","Cool ( 20-24C / 68-75F), Warm (25-30C / 76-85F), Hot (>30C / 86F), Cold (< 20C / 67F)",,,"United Kingdom","1800 - 1849","Green / Red","Large","RHS Award of Garden Merit"

Geneva Tremlett's is a hard-cider variety, almost certainly of traditional English origins (but not related to the English Tremlett's Bitter - see below).
It produces a high quality bittersharp juice, which is useful for blending with other varieties.
As with many old English cider apples, picking takes place very late in the fall.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Geneva Tremlett's cider apple tree is back in stock.
Customers may wonder if there is any relation between the Geneva Tremlett's variety that we sell here, and the traditional English cider variety called Tremlett's Bitter. The answer is there is no relation, and crucially for cider-making purposes, the Geneva Tremlett's is a bittersharp whereas the English variety is a bittersweet.
Nevertheless there is an unusual connection between these two varieties! For many years the USDA at Geneva, NY, maintained scionwood of the original English Tremlett's Bitter, and this was supplied to nurseries throughout the USA who wished to propagate this well-known English cider variety. However it recently came to light that this scionwood had been mis-cataloged, and was not the English Tremlett's Bitter.

The differences are quite obvious - compare our photo, top, with this photo used on our UK sister site. Note the more pointed shape of the English variety. (Sorry, we cannot ship trees from the UK to the USA because of phytosanitary restrictions).
However the ""Geneva Tremlett's"" or ""false Tremlett's"" has proved to be a good quality bittersharp cider variety in its own right (not bittersweet like the original) , and if you are looking for a bittersharp variety for your cider blends it is a good candidate.
The true identification of the Geneva Tremlett's has not been confirmed, but one possibility is that the Geneva variety is actually Skyrme's Kernel, another old English cider variety from the county of Herefordshire, rated by the Victorian pomologist Robert Hogg as ""A favourite cider apple in Herefordshire; quite in the first rank"".","Very late","Hard cider",,"2-3 weeks",,"Bittersharp (cider)",,,,,"Average","Not self-fertile",4,"Average","Diploid","Average vigour",,,"Spur-bearer",,,,,,,,,,,,,"United Kingdom","1850 - 1899","Yellow / Red","Small",

"Roberts Crab crab apple tree","Crabapple tree","Malus 'Roberts Crab'
Roberts Crab is an unusual crab-apple, grown both for its attractive ornamental qualities, and for culinary uses.
The abundant spring blossom is dark pink, and the leaves have a bronze tint.
Ripening in late summer, the crab-apples have an unusual dark purple color. They are also very large - the size of small apples.
The main attraction in the kitchen is that the purple fruits have a rich red flesh, making Roberts Crab an excellent variety for crab-apple jams and jellies.
The red flesh also contains anthocynanin compounds, which may have anti-oxidant qualities. A 2009 study by researchers at USDA found Roberts Crab to have particularly high levels of Cyanidin-3-0-galactoside.
The juice is a dark red claret color, which is darker than that of other red-fleshed crab-apples. The juice flavor is sharp and crab-like, and can be used in hard cider blends.

"Bartlett pear tree","Pear tree","Pyrus communis 'Bartlett'
Bartlett is one of the oldest English dessert pears, having been discovered in the late 18th century in England. Examples were soon taken to the USA and it quickly became the most widely-grown pear variety in North America.
If you buy canned pears, they are very likely to be this variety - because one of Bartlett's main weaknesses is that it bruises easily, so most production is canned. However bruising is not likely to be a concern for the backyard orchardist, and Bartlett is a good choice for a small pear orchard, with a very good flavor and fairly easy to grow.

Bartlett is usually a reliable cropper, and easy to grow in most climates, although susceptible to scab in mild damp climates and not tolerant of fireblight.
The pears should be picked just before they are ripe, and then left to ripen indoors.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
The fascinating origins of the Bartlett pear were recorded by the English fruit enthusiast Robert Hogg writing in the 19th century. He credited its discovery to either a Mr Wheeler or a Mr Stair, both schoolmasters in the town of Aldermaston, Berkshire, England some time before 1770. It was subsequently propagated by a nurseryman, Mr Williams of Turnham Green - who named it the Williams pear (perhaps to cut through the confusion surrounding its origins).
In 1799 trees were sent to the United States - a good demonstration of the close ties that already existed between England and the newly-independent United States. The imported Williams pear trees were planted in an orchard near Boston and came to the attention of a local nurseryman, Mr Bartlett, who played an important role in popularising the variety in the USA. It appears the original variety name was uncertain by this stage, so Bartlett (nicely repeating the decision of his English counterpart) decided to give it his own name.
In this way the new variety became known as Bartlett in North America and Williams in the UK and Europe.
Hogg suggests that the Bartlett pear was well suited to the climate of its new home, and was soon regarded as ""the finest pear of its season"". It became a major commercial variety in the USA.","Early","Eating fresh","Good","1 week",,,,"Normal ripening",,,"Average","Partially self-fertile",3,"Average","Diploid","Average vigour",,"Regular","Spur-bearer",,"Poor","Some susceptibility",,"Some susceptibility",,,,"(5) -20F / -29C","Cool ( 20-24C / 68-75F), Warm (25-30C / 76-85F), Cold (< 20C / 67F)",,"Good resistance","United Kingdom","1750 - 1799","Green - light","Average","RHS Award of Garden Merit"

As the name suggests, Flemish Beauty appears to have been arisen in the region of Flanders in northern Belgium. In 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars, the Belgian fruit enthusiast Jean-Baptiste Van Mons came across this variety in the village of Deftinge. Van Mons was undoubtedly the most influential figure in the development of European pears, and brought it to the notice of his wide network of pear enthusiasts. It was quickly taken up by growers in North America, where its exceptional cold-hardiness was a significant advantage.","Mid","Eating fresh","Good","1 week",,,,,,,"Average","Self-fertile",3,"Average",,"Vigorous","Slow to start bearing","Regular","Spur-bearer","Not-suitable","Poor","Very susceptible",,"Some susceptibility",,,,"(4) -30F / -34C","Warm (25-30C / 76-85F)",,,"Belgium","1750 - 1799","Yellow / Orange",,

"Magness pear tree","Pear tree","Magness is a high quality late-season eating pear, developed by the USDA in the mid 20th century. It is a cross between Doyenne du Comice - generally considered the best-flavored of all dessert pears - and the well-regarded American pear, Seckel. As you might expect given that parentage, the flavor is very good, with the buttery melting flesh which is characteristic of the best European pears.
The pears should ripen about 3 weeks after Bartlett - which in most areas will be late September or early October. They should be picked before fully ripe, and then ripened indoors. They can also be stored in a cool place (or a fridge) for several months.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Magness pear tree is back in stock.
Like its relative, Comice, the blossom of Magness is not easy to pollinate, so for best results make sure another compatible pear tree is planted close by.
Although it is not a triploid variety, Magness has some triploid characteristics - it is quite vigorous, the fruits are relatively large, and it is also a poor pollinator of other pear varieties.
Magness is resistant to mildrew and scab and has very good fireblight resistance, making it a good choice for areas prone to this disease.

Philadelphia, USA, mid18th century. The history of the Seckel pear is documented in articles published by fruit enthusiasts in the United States and Europe in the 19th century, and the original tree survived into the late 19th century. It appears to have arisen as a chance seedling of a European pear in about 1760, and at some stage thereafter the land on which it grew was owned by a Mr Seckel (or Seckle) who named it.
