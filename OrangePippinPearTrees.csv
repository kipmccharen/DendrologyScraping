Bartlett pear tree,Pear tree,Partially self-fertile,3,"Pyrus communis 'Bartlett'
Bartlett is one of the oldest English dessert pears, having been discovered in the late 18th century in England. Examples were soon taken to the USA and it quickly became the most widely-grown pear variety in North America.
If you buy canned pears, they are very likely to be this variety - because one of Bartlett's main weaknesses is that it bruises easily, so most production is canned. However bruising is not likely to be a concern for the backyard orchardist, and Bartlett is a good choice for a small pear orchard, with a very good flavor and fairly easy to grow.

Bartlett is usually a reliable cropper, and easy to grow in most climates, although susceptible to scab in mild damp climates and not tolerant of fireblight.
The pears should be picked just before they are ripe, and then left to ripen indoors.

The fascinating origins of the Bartlett pear were recorded by the English fruit enthusiast Robert Hogg writing in the 19th century. He credited its discovery to either a Mr Wheeler or a Mr Stair, both schoolmasters in the town of Aldermaston, Berkshire, England some time before 1770. It was subsequently propagated by a nurseryman, Mr Williams of Turnham Green - who named it the Williams pear (perhaps to cut through the confusion surrounding its origins).
In 1799 trees were sent to the United States - a good demonstration of the close ties that already existed between England and the newly-independent United States. The imported Williams pear trees were planted in an orchard near Boston and came to the attention of a local nurseryman, Mr Bartlett, who played an important role in popularising the variety in the USA. It appears the original variety name was uncertain by this stage, so Bartlett (nicely repeating the decision of his English counterpart) decided to give it his own name.
In this way the new variety became known as Bartlett in North America and Williams in the UK and Europe.
Hogg suggests that the Bartlett pear was well suited to the climate of its new home, and was soon regarded as ""the finest pear of its season"".

Flemish Beauty pear tree,Pear tree,Self-fertile,3,"Flemish Beauty is an old-fashioned European eating pear, with the classic melting buttery flesh which was so highly prized in 19th century Europe. It has a rich sweet flavor.
It ripens mid to late season, typically about 2 weeks after Bartlett.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Flemish Beauty pear tree is back in stock.
Flemish Beauty is one of the most cold-hardy of European pears, capable of tolerating zone 4 winters, and a good choice for the north country. It is also reliably self-fertile, which is unusual amongst European pears.
It will start bearing from a relatively young age.
It's main drawback is susceptibility to fireblight.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
As the name suggests, Flemish Beauty appears to have been arisen in the region of Flanders in northern Belgium. In 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars, the Belgian fruit enthusiast Jean-Baptiste Van Mons came across this variety in the village of Deftinge. Van Mons was undoubtedly the most influential figure in the development of European pears, and brought it to the notice of his wide network of pear enthusiasts. It was quickly taken up by growers in North America, where its exceptional cold-hardiness was a significant advantage.",Mid,Eating fresh,Good,1 week,,Average,Average,,Vigorous,Regular,Spur-bearer,Poor,Some susceptibility,Very susceptible,(4) -30F / -34C,Warm (25-30C / 76-85F),,Belgium,1750 - 1799,Yellow / Orange,,,Slow to start bearing,Not-suitable,,

Magness pear tree,Pear tree,Not self-fertile,3,"Magness is a high quality late-season eating pear, developed by the USDA in the mid 20th century. It is a cross between Doyenne du Comice - generally considered the best-flavored of all dessert pears - and the well-regarded American pear, Seckel. As you might expect given that parentage, the flavor is very good, with the buttery melting flesh which is characteristic of the best European pears.
The pears should ripen about 3 weeks after Bartlett - which in most areas will be late September or early October. They should be picked before fully ripe, and then ripened indoors. They can also be stored in a cool place (or a fridge) for several months.
Fill in the form below and we will notify you when Magness pear tree is back in stock.
Like its relative, Comice, the blossom of Magness is not easy to pollinate, so for best results make sure another compatible pear tree is planted close by.
Although it is not a triploid variety, Magness has some triploid characteristics - it is quite vigorous, the fruits are relatively large, and it is also a poor pollinator of other pear varieties.
Magness is resistant to mildrew and scab and has very good fireblight resistance, making it a good choice for areas prone to this disease.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Magness is named after Dr. John R. Magness, who led the USDA apple and pear breeding programs in the 1930s - 1950s.

Moonglow pear tree,Pear tree,Not self-fertile,3,"Moonglow is a high-quality early-season pear, which usually ripens about a week before Bartlett. The fruits are large with a sweet flavor, reminscent of Bartlett and Comice from which it is descended.
As with most pears, pick slightly early and then ripen indoors. Newly-picked fruits will have some acidity and can be used at this point for cooking.

Moonglow is very resistant to fireblight, one of the most serious diseases of pears.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Developed in the 1960s by the US Dept.of Agriculture as part of a program to develop pears which were resistant to fireblight. Moonglow is a cross between an old variety called Roi Charles de Wurtemburg and an experimental variety called Michigan 437 which was derived from Bartlett and Comice. This parentage explains its good flavour characteristics.",Early,"Eating fresh, Culinary",Good,1 week,Normal ripening,Average,Good,Diploid,Vigorous,Regular,Spur-bearer,Good,Very resistant,,,"Cool ( 20-24C / 68-75F), Warm (25-30C / 76-85F)",,United States,1950 - 1999,Green - light,,,Precocious,Suitable,,Sweeter
Potomac pear tree,Pear tree,Not self-fertile,3,"Potomac is a modern late-season dessert pear, with good fireblight resistance. The flavour is good, being somewhat similar to the old French variety Beurre d'Anjou which is one of its parents.
It ripens around 2-3 weeks after Bartlett, and the pears can be kept in a fridge for a couple of months.

Seckel pear tree,Pear tree,Not self-fertile,4,"Seckel is a traditional American pear, with a notably sweet sugary flavor. It was discovered in the early 18th century near Philadelphia, and soon established a reputation as a gourmet pear.
The Victorian pomologist Robert Hogg reported that examples were sent to England in the early 19th century, where it was very well received. He describes the flesh as ""... buttery, melting, and very juicy, with a rich and unusually powerful aromatic flavour"".
Although very small, the pears take on an attractive crimson flush when ripe.

Like many antique varieties, Seckel is a tough hardy tree, and a good choice for the backyard orchard.
Although it is not known for certain, Seckel may have some relation to the Bartlett or Williams pear - it cannot cross-pollinate with these varieties.
Advice on fruit tree pollination.
Philadelphia, USA, mid18th century. The history of the Seckel pear is documented in articles published by fruit enthusiasts in the United States and Europe in the 19th century, and the original tree survived into the late 19th century. It appears to have arisen as a chance seedling of a European pear in about 1760, and at some stage thereafter the land on which it grew was owned by a Mr Seckel (or Seckle) who named it.
