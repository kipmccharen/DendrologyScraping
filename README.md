# DendrologyScraping

```python
Gather data about trees, wineries, and fruit trees that grow in the US. 
```

This repository is a home to my scraping and analysis projects about trees, bushes, and vines that grow in Virginia, so that I can better understand and analyze them. 

Maybe this information could be useful! Help yourself!
